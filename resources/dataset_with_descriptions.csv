== History ==

The Roman ‚ü®B‚ü© derived from the Greek capital beta ‚ü®Œí‚ü© via its Etruscan and Cumaean variants. The Greek letter was an adaptation of the Phoenician letter bƒìt ‚ü®ê§Å‚ü©. The Egyptian hieroglyph for the consonant /b/ had been an image of a foot and calf ‚ü®  ‚ü©, but bƒìt (Phoenician for ""house"") was a modified form of a Proto-Sinaitic glyph ‚ü®  ‚ü© adapted from the separate hieroglyph Pr ‚ü®  ‚ü© meaning ""house"". The Hebrew letter bet ‚ü®◊ë‚ü© is a separate development of the Phoenician letter.
By Byzantine times, the Greek letter ‚ü®Œí‚ü© came to be pronounced /v/, so that it is known in modern Greek as v√≠ta (still written Œ≤ŒÆœÑŒ±). The Cyrillic letter ve ‚ü®–í‚ü© represents the same sound, so a modified form known as be ‚ü®–ë‚ü© was developed to represent the Slavic languages' /b/."

Toyota Motor;Consumer durables;"Toyota Motor Corporation (Japanese: „Éà„É®„ÇøËá™ÂãïËªäÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ, Hepburn: Toyota Jid≈çsha kabushikigaisha, IPA: [toÍúújota], English: , commonly known as simply Toyota) is a Japanese multinational automotive manufacturer headquartered in Toyota City, Aichi, Japan. It was founded by Kiichiro Toyoda and incorporated on August 28, 1937. Toyota is the largest automobile manufacturer in the world, producing about 10 million vehicles per year.
The company was founded as a spinoff of Toyota Industries, a machine maker started by Sakichi Toyoda, Kiichiro's father. Both companies are now part of the Toyota Group, one of the largest conglomerates in the world. While still a department of Toyota Industries, the company developed its first product, the Type A engine, in 1934 and its first passenger car in 1936, the Toyota AA.
After World War II, Toyota benefited from Japan's alliance with the United States to learn from American automakers and other companies, which gave rise to The Toyota Way (a management philosophy) and the Toyota Production System (a lean manufacturing practice) that transformed the small company into a leader in the industry and was the subject of many academic studies.
In the 1960s, Toyota took advantage of the rapidly growing Japanese economy to sell cars to a growing middle-class, leading to the development of the Toyota Corolla, which became the world's all-time best-selling automobile. The booming economy also funded an international expansion that allowed Toyota to grow into one of the largest automakers in the world, the largest company in Japan and the ninth-largest company in the world by revenue, as of December 2020. Toyota was the world's first automobile manufacturer to produce more than 10 million vehicles per year, a record set in 2012, when it also reported the production of its 200 millionth vehicle. By September 2023, total production reached 300 million vehicles."

Wal-Mart Stores;Retailing;"Peckham Rock, also called Wall Art, is a 2005 artwork by British street artist Banksy, in the form of a lump of concrete decorated in the style of a cave painting and depicting ""a supposed prehistoric figure pushing a shopping trolley"". It was originally displayed in the British Museum, without the knowledge of the museum staff, after being installed there by Banksy.


== Original installation ==
Peckham Rock is a piece of concrete, approximately 15 cm √ó 25 cm, supposedly sourced from Peckham but actually from Hackney. It depicts a buffalo, pierced by arrows, and a ""lumbering hominin-like figure"" pushing a shopping trolley.
In a 2005 art intervention, Banksy clandestinely attached the rock to a wall in the ""Roman Britain"" collection of the British Museum, with a placard in the style of the museum with the title ""Wall art"" that dated the piece to the ""post catatonic era"" and credited it to a little-known artist named ""Banksymus Maximus"".
The work went undiscovered for ""several days"", with later sources giving more specific but inconsistent amounts of time ranging from ""three days"", to ""weeks"". It was not the first such installation by Banksy; in 2003, he similarly hung a painting in the Tate, and earlier in 2005, he installed a fake beetle in the American Museum of Natural History in New York.


== Subsequent exhibits ==
After Peckham Rock was removed from the British Museum's walls, it was re-exhibited in 2005 at the Outside Institute in London, listed as on loan from Banksy and the British Museum.
Banksy stated that he did not intend to retrieve Peckham Rock, and the British Museum wrote at the time that they were accepting it ""as a donation to its collections"". However, it was eventually labelled as ""lost property"" and returned to Banksy."

Nestle;Food drink & tobacco;"A nest is a structure built for certain animals to hold eggs or young.  Although nests are most closely associated with birds, members of all classes of vertebrates and some invertebrates construct nests.  They may be composed of organic material such as twigs, grass, and leaves, or may be a simple depression in the ground, or a hole in a rock, tree, or building. Human-made materials, such as string, plastic, cloth, or paper, may also be used. Nests can be found in all types of habitat.
Nest building is driven by a biological urge known as the nesting instinct in birds and mammals. Generally each species has a distinctive style of nest.  Nest complexity is roughly correlated with the level of parental care by adults.  Nest building is considered a key adaptive advantage among birds, and they exhibit the most variation in their nests ranging from simple holes in the ground to elaborate communal nests hosting hundreds of individuals.  Nests of prairie dogs and several social insects can host millions of individuals."
SBC Communications;Telecommunications services;"All Terrain Walkers are armored fighting vehicles from the Star Wars universe that traverse the landscape on mechanical legs. They are used by the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, and the First Order for ground assault, reconnaissance or transport. Throughout the saga walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) is responsible for their animation and design, often using models, stop-motion animation, and relevant matte paintings to depict their presence in the films.
There are a variety of walkers: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi introduced the All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) and All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST).  Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith and The Clone Wars introduced earlier Clone Wars-era models of walkers, such as the All-Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), and the All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT). The Star Wars Legends continuity features numerous walker variants, several which have been merchandised in popular culture, while the later films Rogue One and Star Wars: The Last Jedi depicted, respectively, the former the AT-ACT variant to the standard AT-AT, the latter a restyled AT-AT for its new and more modern setting, and a new, even larger walker known as the AT-M6.

The formation of HBOS was heralded as creating a fifth force in British banking as it created a company of comparable size and stature to the established Big Four UK retail banks. It was also the UK's largest mortgage lender. The HBOS Group Reorganisation Act 2006 saw the transfer of Halifax plc and Capital Bank plc to the Bank of Scotland, which had by then become a registered public limited company, Bank of Scotland plc.
Although officially HBOS was not an acronym of any specific words, it is widely presumed to stand for Halifax Bank of Scotland. The corporate headquarters of the group were located on The Mound in Edinburgh, Scotland, the former head office of the Bank of Scotland. Its operational headquarters were in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England, the former head office of Halifax.
On 19 January 2009, the group was acquired by Lloyds TSB and became a subsidiary of Lloyds Banking Group after both sets of shareholders approved the deal."

AXA Group;Insurance;"An axe (; sometimes spelled ax in American English; see spelling differences) is an implement that has been used for thousands of years to shape, split, and cut wood, to harvest timber, and as a weapon. The axe has many forms and specialised uses but generally consists of a head with a handle (also called ""haft"" or ""helve"").
Before the modern axe, the stone-age hand axe without a handle was used from 1.5 million years BP. Hafted axes (those with a handle) date only from 6,000 BC. The earliest examples of handled axes have heads of stone with some form of wooden handle attached (hafted) in a method to suit the available materials and use. Axes made of copper, bronze, iron and steel appeared as these technologies developed.
The axe is an example of a simple machine, as it is a type of wedge, or dual inclined plane. This reduces the effort needed by the wood chopper. It splits the wood into two parts by the pressure concentration at the blade. The handle of the axe also acts as a lever allowing the user to increase the force at the cutting edge. Generally, cutting axes, which are used for felling, limbing, and bucking, have a shallow (acute) wedge angle, whereas splitting axes have a deeper (more obtuse) angle. Most axes are double bevelled (i.e."

Sony;Consumer durables;"A song is a musical composition performed by the human voice. The voice often carries the melody (a series of distinct and fixed pitches) using patterns of sound and silence. Songs have a structure, such as the common ABA form, and are usually made of sections that are repeated or performed with variation later. A song without instruments is said to be a cappella.
Written words created specifically for music, or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in the classical tradition, it is called an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs composed in a simple style that are learned informally by ear are often referred to as folk songs. Songs composed for the mass market, designed to be sung by professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows, are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers, and lyricists; art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances."

He pursued a strategy of growth and diversification, changing the parent corporation's name to United Technologies Corporation (UTC) in 1975 to reflect the intent to diversify into numerous high tech fields beyond aerospace. (The change became official on May 1, 1975.) The diversification was partially to balance civilian business against any overreliance on military business. UTC became a mergers and acquisitions (M&A)‚Äìfocused organization, with various forced takeovers of unwilling smaller corporations. The next year (1976), UTC forcibly acquired Otis Elevator. In 1979, Carrier Refrigeration and Mostek were acquired; the Carrier deal was forcible, while the Mostek deal was a white knight move against hostile takeover designs by Gould."

Dow Chemical;Chemicals;"The Dow Chemical Company is an American multinational corporation headquartered in Midland, Michigan, United States. The company was among the three largest chemical producers in the world in 2021. It is the operating subsidiary of Dow Inc., a publicly traded holding company incorporated under Delaware law.
With a presence in around 160 countries, it employs about 36,000 people worldwide. Dow has been called the ""chemical companies' chemical company"", as its sales are to other industries rather than directly to end-use consumers. Dow is a member of the American Chemistry Council.
In 2015, Dow and fellow chemical company DuPont agreed to a corporate reorganization involving the merger of Dow and DuPont followed by a separation into three different entities. The plan commenced in 2017, when Dow and DuPont merged to form DowDuPont, and was finalized in April 2019, when the materials science division was spun off from DowDuPont and took the name of the Dow Chemical Company.

=== Early history ===

Dow was founded in 1897 by chemist Herbert Henry Dow, who invented a new method of extracting the bromine that was trapped underground in brine at Midland, Michigan. The company originally sold only bleach and potassium bromide, achieving a bleach output of 72 tons a day in 1902."
Aegon Insurance Group;Insurance;"Agon (Ancient Greek: ·ºÄŒ≥œéŒΩ) is the Greek personification for a conflict, struggle or contest, describing a concept of the same name. This could be a contest in athletics, in chariot or horse racing, or in music or literature at a public festival in ancient Greece. Agon is the word-forming element in 'agony', explaining the concept of agon(y) in tragedy by its fundamental characters, the protagonist and antagonist.


== Athletics ==
In one sense, agon meant a contest or a competition in athletics, for example, the Olympic Games (·ΩàŒªœÖŒºœÄŒπŒ±Œ∫Œø·Ω∂ ·ºàŒ≥·ø∂ŒΩŒµœÇ). Agon was also a mythological personification of the contests listed above. This god was represented in a statue at Olympia with halteres (dumbbells) (·ºÅŒªœÑ·øÜœÅŒµœÇ) in his hands.  This statue was a work of sculptor Dionysius, and dedicated by Micythus of Rhegium.


== Religion ==
According to Pausanias, Agon was recognized in the Greek world as a deity, whose statue appeared at Olympia, presumably in connection with the Olympic Games, which operated as both religious festival in honor of Zeus and athletic competition. Agon is, perhaps, more of a spirit than a god in Greek mythology, but was understood to be related to both Zelos (rivalry) and Nike (victory). More generally, Agon referred to any competitive event that was held in connection with religious festivals, including athletics, music, or dramatic performances."
Dexia;Banking;"Dexia N.V./S.A., or the Dexia Group, is a Franco-Belgian financial institution formed in 1996. At its peak in 2010, it had about 35,200 members of staff and a core shareholders' equity of ‚Ç¨19.2 billion.
In 2008, the bank entered severe financial difficulties and received taxpayer bailouts for ‚Ç¨6 billion, and it became the first big casualty of the 2011 European sovereign debt crisis. Due to big losses, suffered among others from the debt haircut on Greek government bonds, its Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio became negative during the second half of 2011, and an orderly resolution process began in October 2011. 
As part of the resolution, Dexia Bank Belgium was bought out from the Dexia group by the Belgian state and has continued to operate, since March 2012 under the new name Belfius. The French bank focused on local government lending was restructured as SFIL. The remaining part of the Dexia group was left in a ""bad bank"", still called Dexia, to be gradually wound down.


== Profile ==
In the 2010 Fortune Global 500 (which lists companies by total income) Dexia was ranked 49th, the top-ranked Belgian company.
The company was founded in 1996 through the merger of Cr√©dit Communal de Belgique (founded in 1860) and Cr√©dit Local de France (founded in 1987). The Dexia Group was founded as a dual-listed company, but in 1999 the Belgian entity took over the French entity to form one company. The company is headquartered in Brussels, Belgium."

Lehman Bros Holdings;Diversified financials;"Lehman Brothers Inc. ( LEE-m…ôn) was an American global financial services firm founded in 1850. Before filing for bankruptcy in 2008, Lehman was the fourth-largest investment bank in the United States (behind Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Merrill Lynch), with about 25,000 employees worldwide. It was doing business in investment banking, equity, fixed-income and derivatives sales and trading (especially U.S. Treasury securities), research, investment management, private equity, and private banking. Lehman was operational for 158 years from its founding in 1850 until 2008.
On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection following the exodus of most of its clients, drastic declines in its stock price, and the devaluation of assets by credit rating agencies. The collapse was largely due to Lehman's involvement in the subprime mortgage crisis and its exposure to less liquid assets. Lehman's bankruptcy filing is the largest in US history, having beaten the previous record holder Worldcom, Inc., and is thought to have played a major role in the unfolding of the 2008 financial crisis. The market collapse also gave support to the ""too big to fail"" doctrine.
After Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy, global markets immediately plummeted."
PepsiCo;Food drink & tobacco;"Pepsi is a carbonated soft drink with a cola flavor, manufactured by PepsiCo which serves as its flagship product. In 2023, Pepsi was the second most valuable soft drink brand worldwide behind Coca-Cola; the two share a long-standing rivalry in what has been called the ""cola wars"".
Pepsi, originally created in 1893 by Caleb Bradham and named ""Brad's Drink,"" was first sold in his drugstore in New Bern, North Carolina. Renamed Pepsi-Cola in 1898 due to its supposed digestive benefits, it was shortened to Pepsi in 1961. The beverage's formula initially included sugar and vanilla but not pepsin, despite speculation on the origin of its name. Early on, Pepsi struggled with financial stability, going bankrupt in 1923 but was subsequently purchased and revived by Charles Guth, who reformulated the syrup. Pepsi gained popularity with the introduction of a 12-ounce bottle during the Great Depression and clever marketing strategies like the ""Nickel, Nickel"" jingle, doubling sales by emphasizing its value.
The mid-20th century saw Pepsi targeting the African American market, a then-untapped demographic, with positive portrayals and endorsements from prominent figures, boosting its market share. Despite occasional controversies, such as an aborted Madonna advertisement and the ""Pepsi Number Fever"" fiasco in the Philippines, Pepsi has remained a prominent global brand, partly thanks to innovative marketing campaigns and sponsorships in sports and entertainment.
Pepsi's rivalry with Coca-Cola, highlighted by the ""cola wars"", led to significant cultural and market competition, including the ""Pepsi Challenge"" taste tests and the introduction of New Coke in response."

Boeing;Aerospace & defense;"Boxing is a combat sport and martial art. Taking place in a boxing ring, it involves two people ‚Äì usually wearing protective equipment, such as protective gloves, hand wraps, and mouthguards ‚Äì throwing punches at each other for a predetermined amount of time.
Although the term ""boxing"" is commonly attributed to western boxing, in which only fists are involved, it has developed in different ways in different geographical areas and cultures of the World. In global terms, ""boxing"" today is also a set of combat sports focused on striking, in which two opponents face each other in a fight using at least their fists, and possibly involving other actions, such as kicks, elbow strikes, knee strikes, and headbutts, depending on the rules. Some of these variants are the bare-knuckle boxing, kickboxing, Muay Thai, Lethwei, savate, and sanda. Boxing techniques have been incorporated into many martial arts, military systems, and other combat sports.
Humans have engaged in hand-to-hand combat since the earliest days of human history. The origins of boxing in any of its forms as a sport remain uncertain, but some sources suggest that it has prehistoric roots in what is now Ethiopia, emerging as early as the sixth millennium BC. It is believed that when the Egyptians invaded Nubia, they adopted boxing from the local populace, subsequently popularizing it in Egypt. From there, the sport of boxing spread to various regions, including Greece, eastward to Mesopotamia, and northward to Rome.
The earliest visual evidence of any type of boxing is from Egypt and Sumer, both from the third millennia, and can be seen in Sumerian carvings from the third and second millennia BC. The earliest evidence of boxing rules dates back to Ancient Greece, where boxing was established as an Olympic game in 688 BC. Boxing evolved from 16th- and 18th-century prizefights, largely in Great Britain, to the forerunner of modern boxing in the mid-19th century with the 1867 introduction of the Marquess of Queensberry Rules."

News Corp;Media;"The second and current incarnation of News Corporation, doing business as News Corp, is an American mass media and publishing company headquartered at 1211 Avenue of the Americas in Midtown Manhattan, New York City. The company was formed on June 28, 2013, as a spin-off of the first News Corporation, whose legal successor was 21st Century Fox, which held its media and entertainment assets. Operating across digital real estate information, news media, book publishing, and cable television, News Corp's notable assets include Dow Jones & Company, which is the publisher of The Wall Street Journal; News UK, publisher of The Sun and The Times; News Corp Australia; and REA Group, operator of realestate.com.au, realtor.com, and book publisher HarperCollins.
News Corp and 21st Century Fox are two companies that succeeded the original News Corp., which included Fox Entertainment Group and other broadcasting and media properties. The spin-out was structured so that 21CF was the legal continuation of the original News Corporation, with the new News Corp being a new company formed by a stock split. Since March 19, 2019, Fox Corporation, which holds 21st Century Fox's national broadcasting, news and sports assets, is also under the Murdoch family's control. On September 21, 2023, Rupert Murdoch announced he would step down as News Corp's chairman by November.


== History ==


=== Formation ===
On June 28, 2012, Rupert Murdoch announced that News Corporation's publishing operations would be spun off to form a new, publicly traded company. Murdoch stated that performing this split would ""unlock the true value of both companies and their distinct assets, enabling investors to benefit from the separate strategic opportunities resulting from more focused management of each division"". The move also came in the wake of a series of scandals that had damaged the reputation of multiple News Corporation-owned properties."

Dell;Technology hardware & equipment;"Del, or nabla, is an operator used in mathematics (particularly in vector calculus) as a vector differential operator, usually represented by the nabla symbol ‚àá. When applied to a function defined on a one-dimensional domain, it denotes the standard derivative of the function as defined in calculus. When applied to a field (a function defined on a multi-dimensional domain), it may denote any one of three operations depending on the way it is applied: the gradient or (locally) steepest slope of a scalar field (or sometimes of a vector field, as in the Navier‚ÄìStokes equations); the divergence of a vector field; or the curl (rotation) of a vector field.
Del is a very convenient mathematical notation for those three operations (gradient, divergence, and curl) that makes many equations easier to write and remember.  The del symbol (or nabla) can be formally defined as a vector operator whose components are the corresponding partial derivative operators. As a vector operator, it can act on scalar and vector fields in three different ways, giving rise to three different differential operations: first, it can act on scalar fields by a formal scalar multiplication‚Äîto give a vector field called the gradient; second, it can act on vector fields by a formal dot product‚Äîto give a scalar field called the divergence; and lastly, it can act on vector fields by a formal cross product‚Äîto give a vector field called the curl. These formal products do not necessarily commute with other operators or products.  These three uses, detailed below, are summarized as:

As a vector operator, del naturally acts on scalar fields via scalar multiplication, and naturally acts on vector fields via dot products and cross products.
More specifically, for any scalar field

AT&T;Telecommunications services;"All Terrain Walkers are armored fighting vehicles from the Star Wars universe that traverse the landscape on mechanical legs. They are used by the Old Republic, the Galactic Empire, and the First Order for ground assault, reconnaissance or transport. Throughout the saga walkers have played a pivotal role in the fate of characters and the outcome of battles. Industrial Light and Magic (ILM) is responsible for their animation and design, often using models, stop-motion animation, and relevant matte paintings to depict their presence in the films.
There are a variety of walkers: The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi introduced the All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) and All Terrain Scout Transport (AT-ST).  Star Wars: Episode II ‚Äì Attack of the Clones, Star Wars: Episode III ‚Äì Revenge of the Sith and The Clone Wars introduced earlier Clone Wars-era models of walkers, such as the All-Terrain Tactical Enforcer (AT-TE), and the All Terrain Recon Transports (AT-RT). The Star Wars Legends continuity features numerous walker variants, several which have been merchandised in popular culture, while the later films Rogue One and Star Wars: The Last Jedi depicted, respectively, the former the AT-ACT variant to the standard AT-AT, the latter a restyled AT-AT for its new and more modern setting, and a new, even larger walker known as the AT-M6.


== All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) ==

The All Terrain Armored Transport (AT-AT) is a quadruped mechanized infantry combat vehicle used by Imperial ground forces.
The AT-AT (pronounced either casually as 'at at', or using only the letters 'A.T. A.T.') was first introduced in The Empire Strikes Back (as the Galactic Empire's main units against Rebel Alliance infantry during the Battle of Hoth) and also appears in Return of the Jedi and in Rogue One (in the AT-ACT variant). 
The AT-AT also appears in a destroyed form in Star Wars: The Force Awakens, explained in the video game Star Wars Battlefront (2015) to be a residue of the Battle of Jakku, which was the Empire's last defeat and resulted in its dissolution, where Rey uses its husk for shelter."
Statoil Group;Oil & gas operations;"A solar equinox is a moment in time when the Sun appears directly above the equator, rather than to its north or south. On the day of the equinox, the Sun appears to rise directly east and set directly west. This occurs twice each year, around 20 March and 23 September.
An equinox is equivalently defined as the time when the plane of Earth's equator passes through the geometric center of the Sun's disk. This is also the moment when Earth's rotation axis is directly perpendicular to the Sun-Earth line, tilting neither toward nor away from the Sun. In modern times, since the Moon (and to a lesser extent the planets) causes Earth's orbit to vary slightly from a perfect ellipse, the equinox is officially defined by the Sun's more regular ecliptic longitude rather than by its declination. The instants of the equinoxes are currently defined to be when the apparent geocentric longitude of the Sun is 0¬∞ and 180¬∞.
The word is derived from the Latin aequinoctium, from aequus (equal) and nox (night). On the day of an equinox, daytime and nighttime are of approximately equal duration all over the planet. Contrary to popular belief, they are not exactly equal because of the angular size of the Sun, atmospheric refraction, and the rapidly changing duration of the length of day that occurs at most latitudes around the equinoxes."

== History ==


=== Squibb ===

The Squibb corporation was founded in 1858 by Edward Robinson Squibb in Brooklyn, New York. Squibb was known as an advocate of quality control and high purity standards early within the pharmaceutical industry. He went on to self-publish an alternative to the U.S. Pharmacopeia titled Squibb's Ephemeris of Materia Medica, after failing to convince the American Medical Association to incorporate higher purity standards.
Materia Medica, Squibb products, and Edward Squibb's opinion on the fundamentals of pharmacy are found in many medical papers of the late 1800s."
AstraZeneca;Drugs & biotechnology;"AstraZeneca plc () (AZ) is a British-Swedish multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology company with its headquarters at the Cambridge Biomedical Campus in Cambridge, United Kingdom. It has a portfolio of products for major diseases in areas including oncology, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, infection,  neuroscience, respiratory, and inflammation.
The company was founded in 1999 through the merger of the Swedish Astra AB and the British Zeneca Group (itself formed by the demerger of the pharmaceutical operations of Imperial Chemical Industries in 1993). Its portfolio includes primary and speciality care, coverage for rare diseases, and a robust global presence across various regions. Since the merger it has been among the world's largest pharmaceutical companies and has made numerous corporate acquisitions, including Cambridge Antibody Technology (in 2006), MedImmune (in 2007), Spirogen (in 2013) and Definiens (by MedImmune in 2014). It has its research and development concentrated in three strategic centres: Cambridge, United Kingdom;  Gothenburg, Sweden and Gaithersburg in Maryland, U.S.
AstraZeneca traces its earliest corporate history to 1913, when Astra AB was formed by a large group of doctors and apothecaries in S√∂dert√§lje. Throughout the twentieth century, it grew into the largest pharmaceutical company in Sweden. Its British counterpart, Zeneca PLC was formed in 1993 when ICI divested its pharmaceuticals businesses; Astra AB and Zeneca PLC merged six years later, with the chosen headquarters in the United Kingdom.
AstraZeneca's primary listing is on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index; it also has a secondary listing on Nasdaq Stockholm. It is also listed on the American Nasdaq and is a Nasdaq-100 company."

It split off its research-based pharmaceuticals business into AbbVie in 2013.
Abbott's products include Pedialyte, Similac, BinaxNOW, Ensure, Glucerna, ZonePerfect, FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and MitraClip.


== History ==


=== Foundation and early history ===

In 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857‚Äì1921), an 1885 graduate of the University of Michigan, founded the Abbott Alkaloidal Company in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practising physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was formulating the active part of alkaloid  medicinal plants‚Äîmorphine, quinine, strychnine and codeine‚Äîas tiny ""dosimetric granules"", producing more consistent and effective dosages for patients than the liquid preparations previously used, which deteriorated over time. In 1922, the company moved from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.


=== International expansion ===
Abbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907; the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada. Abbott India Ltd was originally incorporated on August 22, 1944, as Boots Pure Drug Company (India) Ltd."
BHP Billiton;Materials;"BP p.l.c. (formerly The British Petroleum Company p.l.c. and BP Amoco p.l.c.; stylised in all lowercase) is a British multinational oil and gas company headquartered in London, England. It is one of the oil and gas ""supermajors"" and one of the world's largest companies measured by revenues and profits. It is a vertically integrated company operating in all areas of the oil and gas industry, including exploration and extraction, refining, distribution and marketing, power generation, and trading.
BP's origins date back to the founding of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company in 1909, established as a subsidiary of Burmah Oil Company to exploit oil discoveries in Iran. In 1935, it became the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and in 1954, adopted the name British Petroleum. BP acquired majority control of Standard Oil of Ohio in 1978. Formerly majority state-owned, the British government privatised the company in stages between 1979 and 1987. BP merged with Amoco in 1998, becoming BP Amoco p.l.c., and acquired ARCO, Burmah Castrol and Aral AG shortly thereafter."

Prudential Financial;Insurance;"Prudential Financial, Inc. is an American financial services company whose subsidiaries provide insurance, retirement planning, investment management, and other products and services to both retail and institutional customers throughout the United States and in over 40 other countries. In 2019, Prudential was the largest insurance provider in the United States with $815.1 billion in total assets. The company is included in the  Fortune Global 500 and Fortune 500 rankings.


== Logo ==
The use of Prudential's symbol, the Rock of Gibraltar, began after an advertising agent passed Laurel Hill, a volcanic neck, in Secaucus, New Jersey, on a train in the 1890s.  The related slogans ""Get a Piece of the Rock"" and ""Strength of Gibraltar"" are also still quite widely associated with Prudential, though current advertising uses neither of these. Through the years, the symbol went through various versions, but in 1989, a simplified pictogram symbol of the Rock of Gibraltar was adopted and has been used ever since. The logotype was updated with a proprietary font in 1996. The font, Prudential Roman, was designed by Doyald Young and John March, based on the Century font family.
In fact, in Jacksonville a two-ton piece of the Rock of Gibraltar was presented to the city and placed in the lobby of the Prudential Insurance Building in 1955 [1]

== History ==
The former Maryland National Bank, once the largest banking chain in Maryland, originated as the Baltimore Trust Company in the early 1900s. It later was challenged by the expenses and problems from the building of its landmark red brick, masonry, and limestone art deco-style skyscraper in downtown Baltimore at 10 Light Street between East Redwood (known as German Street before World War I) and East Baltimore Streets. Construction began on the new BTC Building in 1924. Upon completion in 1929, it became the tallest building in Baltimore (and Maryland), surpassing the neighboring Citizens National Bank to the south. It opened just before the avalanche of economic disaster and unemployment following the Wall Street crash of 1929. After a series of reorganizations during the ""New Deal"" administration of 32nd President Franklin D. Roosevelt (and his bank holiday shortly after taking office in March 1933), the bank was reorganized as the Maryland National Bank.
Maryland National's parent, bank holding company MNC Financial, began offering credit cards in the 1960s.
In the early 1980s, Maryland banks lobbied the Maryland General Assembly for legislation to permit higher interest rates on credit-card charges, but lawmakers refused. The neighboring state of Delaware, by contrast, had removed interest-rate restrictions in 1981."

Caterpillar;Capital goods;"Caterpillars (  KAT-…ôr-pil-…ôr) are the larval stage of members of the order Lepidoptera (the insect order comprising butterflies and moths).
As with most common names, the application of the word is arbitrary, since the larvae of sawflies (suborder Symphyta) are commonly called caterpillars as well. Both lepidopteran and symphytan larvae have eruciform body shapes.
Caterpillars of most species eat plant material (often leaves), but not all; some (about 1%) eat insects, and some are even cannibalistic. Some feed on other animal products. For example, clothes moths feed on wool, and horn moths feed on the hooves and horns of dead ungulates.
Caterpillars are typically voracious feeders and many of them are among the most serious of agricultural pests. In fact, many moth species are best known in their caterpillar stages because of the damage they cause to fruits and other agricultural produce, whereas the moths are obscure and do no direct harm. Conversely, various species of caterpillar are valued as sources of silk, as human or animal food, or for biological control of pest plants.


== Etymology ==
The origins of the word ""caterpillar"" date from the early 16th century."

Canon;Business services & supplies;"A cannon is a large-caliber gun classified as a type of artillery, which usually launches a projectile using explosive chemical propellant. Gunpowder (""black powder"") was the primary propellant before the invention of smokeless powder during the late 19th century. Cannons vary in gauge, effective range, mobility, rate of fire, angle of fire and firepower; different forms of cannon combine and balance these attributes in varying degrees, depending on their intended use on the battlefield. A cannon is a type of heavy artillery weapon. The word cannon is derived from several languages, in which the original definition can usually be translated as tube, cane, or reed.
The earliest known depiction of cannons may have appeared in Song dynasty China as early as the 12th century; however, solid archaeological and documentary evidence of cannons do not appear until the 13th century. In 1288, Yuan dynasty troops are recorded to have used hand cannons in combat, and the earliest extant cannon bearing a date of production comes from the same period. By the end of the 14th century, cannons were widespread throughout Eurasia.
Cannons were used primarily as anti-infantry weapons until around 1374, when large cannons were recorded to have breached walls for the first time in Europe. Cannons featured prominently as siege weapons."

== History ==


=== 1665‚Äì1789: Manufacture royale ===
Since the mid-17th century, luxury products such as silk textiles, lace, and mirrors were in high demand. In the 1660s, mirrors had become very popular among the upper classes of society: Italian cabinets, ch√¢teaux, ornate side tables, and pier-tables were decorated with these expensive and luxurious products. At the time, however, the French were not known for mirror technology; instead, the Republic of Venice was known as the world leader in glass manufacturing, controlling a technical and commercial monopoly of the glass and mirror business. As a result, French Minister of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert wanted France to become completely self-sufficient in meeting domestic demand for luxury products, thereby strengthening the national economy.
Colbert established, by letters patent, the public enterprise Manufacture royale de glaces de miroirs (French pronunciation: [manyfakty Å  Åwajal d…ô …°las d…ô mi Åwa Å], Royal Mirror-Glass Factory) in October 1665. The company was created for a period of twenty years and would be financed in part by the state. The beneficiary and first director was the French financier Nicolas du Noyer, a receiver of taxes of Orl√©ans, who was granted a monopoly of making glass and mirror-glass for twenty years."

Alcoa is a major producer of primary aluminum, fabricated aluminum, and alumina combined, through its active and growing participation in all major aspects of the industry: technology, mining, refining, smelting, fabricating, and recycling.
Alcoa emerged in 1888 as the brainchild of Charles Martin Hall, with the funding of Alfred E. Hunt and Arthur Vining Davis. Alcoa was the first mass producer of aluminum. Before Alcoa's formation, aluminum was difficult to refine and, as a result, was more expensive than silver or gold. In 1886, Hall discovered the Hall‚ÄìH√©roult process, the first inexpensive technique for refining aluminum, drastically reducing the price of aluminum while increasing its availability. Hall approached Hunt and Davis to form a company to bring his process to market; the three founded Alcoa as the Pittsburgh Reduction Company, which expanded quickly.

Mitsubishi;Trading companies;"The Mitsubishi Group (‰∏âËè±„Ç∞„É´„Éº„Éó, Mitsubishi Gur≈´pu) is a group of autonomous Japanese multinational companies in a variety of industries.
Founded by Yatar≈ç Iwasaki in 1870, the Mitsubishi Group traces its origins to the Mitsubishi zaibatsu, a unified company that existed from 1870 to 1946. The company, along with other major zaibatsu, was disbanded during the occupation of Japan following World War II by the order of the Allies. Despite the dissolution, the former constituent companies continue to share the Mitsubishi brand and trademark.
While the group of companies engages in limited business cooperation, most notably through monthly ‚ÄúFriday Conference‚Äù executive meetings, they remain formally independent and are not under common control. The three main entities (gosanke) are Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (the largest bank in Japan), Mitsubishi Corporation (a general trading company), and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries (diversified manufacturing companies). A 2020 estimate concluded that all the Mitsubishi companies combined generate 7.7% of the total revenue of all publicly traded companies in Japan, and the group's assets amount to 433 trillion yen.


== History ==

The Mitsubishi company was established as a shipping firm by Iwasaki Yatar≈ç (1834‚Äì1885) in 1870 under the name ""Tsukumo Shokai"" (‰πùÂçÅ‰πùÂïÜ‰ºö). In 1873, its name was changed to Mitsubishi Shokai; Mitsubishi (‰∏âËè±) consists of two parts: ""mitsu"" (‰∏â) meaning ""three"" (as in the three oak leaves from the crest of the Yamauchi or Tosa family that ruled over Yatar≈ç's birthplace and employed him) and ""hishi"" (Ëè±, which becomes ""bishi"" under rendaku) meaning ""water caltrop"", and hence ""rhombus"", which is reflected in the company's logo. It is also translated as ""three diamonds""."

M;Conglomerates;"M, or m, is the thirteenth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of several western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is em (pronounced  ), plural ems.


== History ==

The letter M is derived from the Phoenician Mem via the Greek Mu (Œú, Œº). Semitic Mem is most likely derived from a ""Proto-Sinaitic""  (Bronze Age) adoption of the ""water"" ideogram in Egyptian writing. The Egyptian sign had the acrophonic value /n/, from the Egyptian word for ""water"", nt; the adoption as the Semitic letter for /m/ was presumably also on acrophonic grounds, from the Semitic word for ""water"", *mƒÅ(y)-.

== History ==


=== Founding ===
In the early 20th century, Eug√®ne Paul Louis Schueller (1881‚Äì1957), a young French chemist, developed a hair dye formula called Or√©ale. Schueller formulated and manufactured his own products, which he sold to Parisian hairdressers. On 31 July 1909, Schueller registered his company, the Soci√©t√© Fran√ßaise de Teintures Inoffensives pour Cheveux (Safe Hair Dye Company of France). The company eventually became L'Or√©al. In 1920, the company employed three chemists; the number of employees continued to grow with 100 by the year 1950, and 1,000 by the year 1984; as recently as 2021, there was an estimated total of 85,252 worldwide.
L'Or√©al got its start in the hair-colour business, but the company soon branched out into other cleansing and beauty products. As of 2020, L'Or√©al markets in all sectors of the beauty business: hair colour, permanents, hair styling, body and skincare, cleansers, makeup, and fragrance. The company's products are found in a wide variety of outlets, from hair salons and perfumeries to supermarkets, health/beauty outlets, pharmacies, and direct mail."

Bank of New York;Banking;"A boy is a young male human. The term is commonly used for a child or an adolescent. When a male human reaches adulthood, he is usually described as a man.


== Definition, etymology, and use ==
According to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary, a boy is ""a male child from birth to adulthood"".
The word ""boy"" comes from Middle English boi, boye (""boy, servant""), related to other Germanic words for boy, namely East Frisian boi (""boy, young man"") and West Frisian boai (""boy""). Although the exact etymology is obscure, the English and Frisian forms probably derive from an earlier Anglo-Frisian *b≈ç-ja (""little brother""), a diminutive of the Germanic root *b≈ç- (""brother, male relation""), from Proto-Indo-European *bhƒÅ-, *bhƒÅt- (""father, brother""). The root is also found in Norwegian dialectal boa (""brother""), and, through a reduplicated variant *b≈ç-b≈ç-, in Old Norse b√≥fi, Dutch boef ""(criminal) knave, rogue"", German Bube (""knave, rogue, boy""). Furthermore, the word may be related to B≈çia, an Anglo-Saxon personal name.


=== Specific uses ===


==== Race ====
Historically, in the United States and South Africa, ""boy"" was used not only for domestic servants but also more generally as a disparaging term for black men; the term implied a subservient status. Thomas Branch, an early African-American Seventh-day Adventist missionary to Nyassaland (Malawi) referred to the native students as ""boys"":There is one way by which we judge many of our present boys to be quite different from some of those who were here long ago: those that are married have their wives here with them, and build their own houses, and all are busy making their gardens."
Volvo Group;Capital goods;"Polo  is a ball game that is played on horseback as a traditional field sport. It is one of the world's oldest known team sports, having been adopted in the Western world from the game of Chovgan (Persian: ⁄ÜŸà⁄ØÿßŸÜ), which originated in ancient Iran, dating back over 2,000 years. Initially played by Persian nobility as a training exercise for cavalry units, polo eventually spread to other parts of the world. The game is played by two opposing teams with the objective of scoring using a long-handled wooden mallet to hit a small hard ball through the opposing team's goal. Each team has four mounted riders, and the game usually lasts one to two hours, divided into periods called chukkas or chukkers.
Polo has been called ""The Sport of Kings"" and has become a spectator sport for equestrians and high society, often supported by sponsorship. The progenitor of polo and its variants existed from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD, as an equestrian game played by the Iranian peoples. From Iran, where the sport evolved and developed, the game became popular around the world, with well over 100 member countries in the Federation of International Polo, and is played professionally in 16 countries; it was also an Olympic sport from 1900 to 1936.
Arena polo is an indoor or semi-outdoor variant with similar rules, and is played with three riders per team. The playing field is smaller, enclosed and usually of compacted sand or fine aggregate."

Yukos;Oil & gas operations;"OJSC ""Yukos Oil Company"" (Russian: –û–ê–û –ù–µ—Ñ—Ç—è–Ω–∞ÃÅ—è –ö–æ–º–ø–∞ÃÅ–Ω–∏—è –ÆÃÅ–ö–û–°, IPA: [Ààjuk…ôs]) was an oil and gas company based in Moscow, Russia. Yukos was acquired from the Russian government by Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky's Bank Menatep during the controversial ""loans for shares"" auctions of the mid 1990s. Between 1996 and 2003, Yukos became one of the largest and most successful Russian companies, producing 20% of Russia's oil output. In the 2004 Fortune 500, Yukos was ranked as the 359th largest company in the world. In October 2003, Khodorkovsky‚Äîby then the richest person in Russia and 16th richest person in the world‚Äîwas arrested, and the company was forcibly broken up for alleged unpaid taxes shortly after and declared bankrupt in August 2006. Courts in several countries later ruled that the real intent was to destroy Yukos and obtain its assets for the government, and act politically against Khodorkovsky. In 2014, the largest arbitration award in history, $50 billion (‚Ç¨37.2 billion), was won by Yukos' former owners against Russia. This $50 billion award by an arbitral tribunal at the Permanent Court of Arbitration was ruled invalid by the District court in The Hague in 2016, but reinstated by the Court of Appeal of the Hague in 2020.
From 2003 to 2004 onwards, the Russian government presented Yukos with a series of tax claims totaling US$27 billion (‚Ç¨20,1 billion). As the government froze Yukos' assets at the same time, and alternative attempts to settle by Yukos were refused, the company was unable to pay these tax demands."

First Data;Software & services;"A first date is the initial meeting during the dating process of two individuals, in which an effort is made to ask about each other, plan a potential relationship, and/or organize some sort of romantic activity. Aims vary between finding a romantic, platonic, or sexual partner for a short period, to finding a long-term spouse. Dating can vary between cultures, lifestyles, religion, gender, and sexual orientation.
In many countries and cultures, it is the process that romantic relationships are developed and future spouses are found. Some people go on first dates to evaluate a person's potential as a sexual partner. Often, people have dates arranged for them by their friends, or they meet the individual at work, a party, in class, in their community or online on a social media website or dating website. During the date, each participant can evaluate the compatibility of the other person and get the opportunity to screen out individuals who engage in behaviour that a person does not prefer.
There are many possible outcomes on the conclusion of a first date. The two individuals may agree to a second date. One or both parties may decide that there are incompatibility issues and decide not to pursue further dates."

== History ==

The company was established in 1876 with 16 members, including the founder, Takashi Masuda. By the end of World War II, it had become a dominant trading giant, but was dissolved by the order of GHQ.
The current Mitsui & Co. was established in 1947 as Daiichi Bussan Kaisha, Ltd. (First Bussan Corporation Ltd.). In 1959, it merged with several other trading companies and changed its name to Mitsui & Co., Ltd.

Takeda Chemical Inds;Drugs & biotechnology;"Brigatinib, sold under the brand name Alunbrig among others, is a small-molecule targeted cancer therapy being developed by Ariad Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Brigatinib acts as both an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor.
Brigatinib could overcome resistance to osimertinib conferred by the EGFR C797S mutation if it is combined with an anti-EGFR antibody such as cetuximab or panitumumab.


== Mechanism of action ==

Brigatinib is an inhibitor of ALK and mutated EGFR.
ALK was first identified as a chromosomal rearrangement in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL). Genetic studies indicate that abnormal expression of ALK is a key driver of certain types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and neuroblastomas, as well as ALCL. Since ALK is generally not expressed in normal adult tissues, it represents a highly promising molecular target for cancer therapy.
Brigatinib inhibits ROS proto-oncogene-1 fusions and EGFR mutations and has a remarkable effect on the central nervous system.
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is another validated target in NSCLC. Additionally, the T790M ""gatekeeper"" mutation is linked in approximately 50 percent of patients who grow resistant to first-generation EGFR inhibitors. While second-generation EGFR inhibitors are in development, clinical efficacy has been limited due to toxicity thought to be associated with inhibiting the native (endogenous or unmutated) EGFR. A therapy designed to target EGFR, the T790M mutation but avoiding inhibition of native EGFR is another promising molecular target for cancer therapy.

Veolia Environnement;Utilities;"The viola ( vee-OH-l…ô, Italian: [Ààvj…îÀêla, viÀà…îÀêla]) is a string instrument of the violin family, and is usually bowed when played. Violas are slightly larger than violins, and have a lower and deeper sound. Since the 18th century, it has been the middle or alto voice of the violin family, between the violin (which is tuned a perfect fifth higher) and the cello (which is tuned an octave lower). The strings from low to high are typically tuned to C3, G3, D4, and A4.
In the past, the viola varied in size and style, as did its names. The word viola originates from the Italian language. The Italians often used the term viola da braccio, meaning, literally, 'of the arm'. ""Brazzo"" was another Italian word for the viola, which the Germans adopted as Bratsche. The French had their own names: cinquiesme was a small viola, haute contre was a large viola, and taile was a tenor. Today, the French use the term alto, a reference to its range."

Waste Management;Business services & supplies;"Waste management or waste disposal includes the processes and actions required to manage waste from its inception to its final disposal. This includes the collection, transport, treatment, and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process and waste-related laws, technologies, and economic mechanisms.
Waste can either be solid, liquid, or gases and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, chemical, municipal, organic, biomedical, and radioactive wastes. In some cases, waste can pose a threat to human health. Health issues are associated with the entire process of waste management. Health issues can also arise indirectly or directly: directly through the handling of solid waste, and indirectly through the consumption of water, soil, and food. Waste is produced by human activity, for example, the extraction and processing of raw materials. Waste management is intended to reduce the adverse effects of waste on human health, the environment, planetary resources, and aesthetics.
The aim of waste management is to reduce the dangerous effects of such waste on the environment and human health."
Entergy;Utilities;"Energy (from Ancient Greek  ·ºêŒΩŒ≠œÅŒ≥ŒµŒπŒ± (en√©rgeia) 'activity') is the quantitative property that is transferred to a body or to a physical system, recognizable in the performance of work and in the form of heat and light. Energy is a conserved quantity‚Äîthe law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The unit of measurement for energy in the International System of Units (SI) is the joule (J).
Forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object (for instance due to its position in a field), the elastic energy stored in a solid object, chemical energy associated with chemical reactions, the radiant energy carried by electromagnetic radiation, the internal energy contained within a thermodynamic system, and rest energy associated with an object's rest mass. These are not mutually exclusive.
All living organisms constantly take in and release energy. The Earth's climate and ecosystems processes are driven primarily by radiant energy from the sun. The energy industry provides the energy required for human civilization to function, which it obtains from energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, and renewable energy.


== Forms ==

The total energy of a system can be subdivided and classified into potential energy, kinetic energy, or combinations of the two in various ways. Kinetic energy is determined by the movement of an object ‚Äì or the composite motion of the object's components ‚Äì while potential energy reflects the potential of an object to have motion, generally being based upon the object's position within a field or what is stored within the field itself."

Gap;Retailing;"Gas is one of the four fundamental states of matter. The others are solid, liquid, and plasma. A pure gas is made up of individual atoms (e.g. a noble gas like neon) or molecules of either a single type of atom (elements such as oxygen) or from different atoms (compounds such as carbon dioxide). A gas mixture, such as air, contains a variety of pure gases. What distinguishes gases from liquids and solids is the vast separation of the individual gas particles. This separation usually makes a colorless gas invisible to the human observer.
The gaseous state of matter occurs between the liquid and plasma states, the latter of which provides the upper-temperature boundary for gases. Bounding the lower end of the temperature scale lie degenerative quantum gases which are gaining increasing attention.
High-density atomic gases super-cooled to very low temperatures are classified by their statistical behavior as either Bose gases or Fermi gases."

Anthem;Health care equipment & services;"An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work (still frequently seen in Sacred Harp and other types of shape note singing) and still more particularly to a specific form of liturgical music. In this sense, its use began c.‚Äâ1550 in English-speaking churches; it uses English language words, in contrast to the originally Roman Catholic 'motet' which sets a Latin text.


== Etymology ==
Anthem is derived from the Greek ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒØœÜœâŒΩŒ± (ant√≠ph≈çna) via Old English antefn. Both words originally referred to antiphons, a call-and-response style of the singing. The adjectival form is ""anthemic"".


== History ==
Anthems were originally a form of liturgical music. In the Church of England, the rubric appoints them to follow the third collect at morning and evening prayer. Several anthems are included in the British coronation service. The words are selected from Holy Scripture or in some cases from the Liturgy and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that of psalm or hymn tunes."

Xerox;Business services & supplies;"Xenon is a chemical element; it has symbol Xe and atomic number 54. It is a dense, colorless, odorless noble gas found in Earth's atmosphere in trace amounts. Although generally unreactive, it can undergo a few chemical reactions such as the formation of xenon hexafluoroplatinate, the first noble gas compound to be synthesized.
Xenon is used in flash lamps and arc lamps, and as a general anesthetic. The first excimer laser design used a xenon dimer molecule (Xe2) as the lasing medium, and the earliest laser designs used xenon flash lamps as pumps. Xenon is also used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as a propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft.
Naturally occurring xenon consists of seven stable isotopes and two long-lived radioactive isotopes. More than 40 unstable xenon isotopes undergo radioactive decay, and the isotope ratios of xenon are an important tool for studying the early history of the Solar System. Radioactive xenon-135 is produced by beta decay from iodine-135 (a product of nuclear fission), and is the most significant (and unwanted) neutron absorber in nuclear reactors.

Xenon was discovered in England by the Scottish chemist William Ramsay and English chemist Morris Travers on July 12, 1898, shortly after their discovery of the elements krypton and neon."

ScottishPower was formed in 1990, in preparation for the privatisation of the previously state-owned Scottish electricity industry the following year. Previously the UK government had privatised the English and Welsh electricity industry by splitting the market into 12 regional electricity companies (RECs) and two power generators. However, in Scotland, the industry was already organised on an integrated generation, distribution, and supply basis, and this integration survived the privatisation to become a model for the rest of the United Kingdom. ScottishPower was largely formed from the bigger of the two Scottish electricity boards, the South of Scotland Electricity Board, whilst the smaller, the North of Scotland Hydro Board, eventually became part of the Scottish & Southern Energy Group (the nuclear power stations in Scotland were spun off into a third company, Scottish Nuclear, which was not sold off with ScottishPower and Scottish Hydro Electric, but was sold later as part of British Energy)."
Mitsubishi Heavy Inds;Capital goods;"The Mitsubishi A6M ""Zero"" is a long-range carrier-capable fighter aircraft formerly manufactured by Mitsubishi Aircraft Company, a part of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. It was operated by the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) from 1940 to 1945. The A6M was designated as the Mitsubishi Navy Type 0 carrier fighter (Èõ∂ÂºèËâ¶‰∏äÊà¶ÈóòÊ©ü, rei-shiki-kanj≈ç-sent≈çki), or the Mitsubishi A6M Rei-sen. The A6M was usually referred to by its pilots as the Reisen (Èõ∂Êà¶, zero fighter), ""0"" being the last digit of the imperial year 2600 (1940) when it entered service with the IJN. The official Allied reporting name was ""Zeke"", although the name ""Zero"" was used more commonly.
The Zero is considered to have been the most capable carrier-based fighter in the world when it was introduced early in World War II, combining excellent maneuverability, high airspeed, strong firepower and very long range. The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service also frequently used it as a land-based fighter.
In early combat operations, the Zero gained a reputation as a dogfighter, achieving an outstanding kill ratio of 12 to 1, but by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics and the introduction of better equipment enabled Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms. By the middle months of 1943 the deterioration of fighter pilot training in the IJNAS contributed to making the Zero less effective against newer Allied fighters. The Zero lacked hydraulic boosting for its ailerons and rudder, rendering it difficult to maneuver at high speeds. Lack of self-sealing fuel tanks also made it more vulnerable than its contemporaries."

Best Buy;Retailing;"In a film crew, there are two kinds of best boy:  best boy electric (also known as the assistant chief lighting technician) and best boy grip (also known as the 2nd company grip). They are assistants to their department heads, the gaffer (in charge of electricals) and the key grip (lighting and rigging), respectively. In short, the best boy acts as the foreman for the department. A woman who performs these duties may be called best girl.  Recently, some film crews have begun adopting gender-neutral terms for job titles, with one example being ""lead electric"" as a replacement for the term ""best boy"" in the electrical department. In 2024, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees has most recently adopted the terms assistant chief lighting technician and 2nd company grip for the electric and grip departments, respectively.


== Job responsibilities ==
Best boys are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the lighting or grip department. Their many responsibilities include the hiring, scheduling, and management of crew; the renting, ordering, inventory, and returning of equipment; workplace safety and maintaining discipline within their department; completing timecards and other paperwork; stocking of expendables; loading and unloading production trucks; planning and implementing the lighting or rigging of locations and/or sound stages; coordinating with rigging crews and additional photography units (if applicable); handling relations with the other production departments; overseeing the application of union rules (where relevant); and serving as the day-to-day representative of the department with the unit production manager and coordinator of their department.
The best boy also commonly accompanies or stands in for the key grip or gaffer during technical scouts. During shooting, the best boy may also cover for the key grip or gaffer when he or she is on a break or otherwise away from the set."
Sumitomo;Trading companies;"The Sumitomo Group (Japanese: ‰ΩèÂèã„Ç∞„É´„Éº„Éó, Hepburn: Sumitomo Gur≈´pu) is a Japanese corporate group and keiretsu that traces its roots to the zaibatsu groups that were dissolved after World War II. Unlike the zaibatsu of the pre-war period, there is no controlling company with regulatory power. Instead, the companies in the group hold shares in each other, but they are limited to exchanging information and coordinating plans through regular meetings.


== History ==
The Sumitomo Group traces its roots to a bookshop in Kyoto founded circa 1615 by Masatomo Sumitomo, a former Buddhist monk. Even today, management of the group is guided by his ""Founder's Precepts"", written in the 17th century.
Copper refining made the company famous. Riemon Soga, Masatomo Sumitomo's brother-in-law, learned Western methods of copper refining. In 1590, he established a smelting business, Izumiya, literally meaning ""spring shop"". Riemon perfected techniques that allowed the extraction of silver from copper ore, something Japanese technology had not previously accomplished.
The smelting and smithing business was moved from Kyoto to Osaka by the late 17th century. Soga passed control of the company to his son Tomomochi who managed its transformation into a major trading house during the Edo period."

Banco do Brasil;Banking;"Banco do Brasil S.A. (pronounced [Ààb…êÃÉku du b…æaÀàziw], lit.‚Äâ'Bank of Brazil') is a Brazilian financial services company headquartered in Bras√≠lia, Brazil. The oldest bank in Brazil, and among the oldest banks in continuous operation in the world, it was founded by John VI, King of Portugal, on Wednesday, 12 October 1808. It is the second largest banking institution in Brazil, as well as the second largest in Latin America,. Banco do Brasil is controlled by the Brazilian government and is listed at the B3 stock exchange in S√£o Paulo.
It has been one of the four most profitable Brazilian banks since 2000 (along with Ita√∫ Unibanco, Banco Bradesco and Banco Santander) and holds a strong leadership position in retail banking.


== History ==

Banco do Brasil was founded in 1808 by then prince regent John (later King John VI of Portugal) to finance the kingdom's public debt when he moved from Europe to Brazil. ""As a mixed institution under state control, the Banco do Brasil served as a commercial bank, the government's fiscal agent, and Brazil's first bank of issue."" It went bankrupt two times in history: once during independence in 1821, when John VI returned to Portugal taking with him some of the bank's assets, and a second time in 1898.
From 1821 to 1964 Banco do Brasil occasionally performed tasks that exceeded its role as a traditional commercial bank: issuing currency, having the monopoly of currency exchange transactions and serving as National Treasury holder for the government. Such tasks were gradually given to other governmental institutions, mainly with the creation of the Central Bank of Brazil in 1964 and the separation from the National Treasury in 1987.
From 1992 onwards it was restructured as a commercial bank, using its huge geographic distribution and credit assets to leverage its redesign as a ""normal"" bank."

Masco;Construction;"A mascot is any human, animal, or object thought to bring luck, or anything used to represent a group with a common public identity, such as a school, sports team, society, military unit, or brand name. Mascots are also used as fictional, representative spokespeople for consumer products.
In sports, mascots are also used for merchandising. Team mascots are often related to their respective team nicknames. This is especially true when the team's nickname is something that is a living animal and/or can be made to have humanlike characteristics. For more abstract nicknames, the team may opt to have an unrelated character serve as the mascot. For example, the athletic teams of the University of Alabama are nicknamed the Crimson Tide, while their mascot is an elephant named Big Al. Team mascots may take the form of a logo, person, live animal, inanimate object, or a costumed character, and often appear at team matches and other related events. Since the mid-20th century, costumed characters have provided teams with an opportunity to choose a fantasy creature as their mascot, as is the case with the Philadelphia Phillies' mascot: Phillie Phanatic, the Philadelphia Flyers' mascot: Gritty, the Seattle Kraken mascot: Buoy, and the Washington Commanders' mascot: Major Tuddy.
Costumed mascots are commonplace, and are regularly used as goodwill ambassadors in the community for their team, company, or organization."

Sharp;Business services & supplies;"A ship  is a large vessel that travels the world's oceans and other navigable waterways, carrying cargo or passengers, or in support of specialized missions, such as defense, research and fishing. Ships are generally distinguished from boats, based on size, shape, load capacity and purpose. Ships have supported exploration, trade, warfare, migration, colonization, and science. Ship transport is responsible for the largest portion of world commerce.
The word ship has meant, depending on the era and the context, either just a large vessel or specifically a ship-rigged sailing ship with three or more masts, each of which is square-rigged.
The earliest historical evidence of boats is found in Egypt during the 4th millennium BCE. In 2024, ships had a global cargo capacity of 2.4 billion tons, with the three largest classes being ships carrying dry bulk (43%), oil tankers (28%) and container ships (14%).


== Nomenclature ==

Ships are typically larger than boats, but there is no universally accepted distinction between the two. Ships generally can remain at sea for longer periods of time than boats. A legal definition of ship from Indian case law is a vessel that carries goods by sea. A common notion is that a ship can carry a boat, but not vice versa."

They were historically also referred to as Afghans until 1964 after the term's meaning had become a demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan regardless of their ethnic group.
The Pashtuns speak the Pashto language, which belongs to the Eastern Iranian branch of the Iranian language family. Additionally, Dari serves as the second language of Pashtuns in Afghanistan, while those in Pakistan speak Urdu and English. In India, the majority of those of Pashtun descent have lost the ability to speak Pashto and instead speak Hindi and other regional languages.
There are an estimated 350‚Äì400 Pashtun tribes and clans with a variety of origin theories. In 2021, Shahid Javed Burki estimated the total Pashtun population to be situated between 60 and 70 million, with 15 million in Afghanistan. Others who accept the 15 million figure include British academic Tim Willasey-Wilsey as well as Abubakar Siddique, a journalist specializing in Afghan affairs. This figure is disputed due to the lack of an official census in Afghanistan since 1979 due to continuing conflicts there.
They are the second-largest ethnic group in Pakistan and the largest ethnic group in Afghanistan, constituting around 18.24% of the total Pakistani population and around 47% of the total Afghan population."

Compass Group has its origins in a company which was founded by Jack Bateman in 1941 as Factory Canteens Limited; subsequently, the company became known as Bateman Catering. Bateman Catering and Midland Catering were acquired by conglomerate Grand Metropolitan in 1967 and 1968 respectively and a management buy-out from Grand Metropolitan followed in 1987 when the Compass Group was formed.


=== Public listing ===
Compass Group was first listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1988. Eurest, one of the company's US subsidiaries, was launched in the United States in 1996 to provide dining services to local, regional and national companies within the business and industry markets, including employee dining centers, on-site catering, vending, executive dining, and other services.

== History ==


=== Founding ===
In 1973, world oil prices quadrupled due to the Arab oil embargo following the Yom Kippur War. The province of Alberta had substantial oil reserves, whose extraction had long been controlled by American corporations.  The government of Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the opposition New Democratic Party felt that these corporations geared most of their production to the American market, and as a result little of the benefit of rising oil prices went to Canadians. During debates in the Canadian House of Commons, for example, Tommy Douglas supported the new Crown Corporation by saying: ""It should be remembered that the people of Canada have paid billions of dollars to enlarge and enrich foreign oil companies, and only now, belatedly, are we setting up an economic vehicle to develop our petroleum resources for the benefit of Canadians.""
Trudeau's Liberals were then in a minority government and dependent upon the support of the NDP to stay in power. The idea also fit with the growing movement toward economic nationalism within the Liberals."

Nippon Oil;Oil & gas operations;"In Greco-Roman mythology, Aeneas ( in-EE-…ôs, Classical Latin: [aeÃØÀàneÀêaÀês]; from Ancient Greek: Œë·º∞ŒΩŒµŒØ·æ±œÇ, romanized: Aine√≠ƒÅs) was a Trojan hero, the son of the Trojan prince Anchises and the Greek goddess Aphrodite (equivalent to the Roman Venus). His father was a first cousin of King Priam of Troy (both being grandsons of Ilus, founder of Troy), making Aeneas a second cousin to Priam's children (such as Hector and Paris). He is a minor character in Greek mythology and is mentioned in Homer's Iliad. Aeneas receives full treatment in Roman mythology, most extensively in Virgil's Aeneid, where he is cast as an ancestor of Romulus and Remus. He became the first true hero of Rome. Snorri Sturluson identifies him with the Norse god V√≠√∞arr of the √Üsir.


== Etymology ==

Aeneas is the Romanization of the hero's original Greek name Œë·º∞ŒΩŒµŒØŒ±œÇ (Aine√≠as). Aine√≠as is first introduced in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite when Aphrodite gives him his name from the adjective Œ±·Ω∂ŒΩ√≥ŒΩ
(ainon,
""terrible""), for the ""terrible grief"" (Œ±·Ω∂ŒΩ√≥ŒΩ ·ºÑœáŒøœÇ) he has caused her by being born a mortal who will age and die. It is a popular etymology for the name, apparently exploited by Homer in the Iliad. Later in the Medieval period there were writers who held that, because the Aeneid was written by a philosopher, it is meant to be read philosophically."

Old Mutual;Diversified financials;"Old Mutual (officially Old Mutual Limited) is a South African investment, savings, insurance, and banking group, operating across Africa. It is listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange, the Namibian Stock Exchange and the Botswana Stock Exchange.
Old Mutual was founded in South Africa by John Fairbairn in 1845 and was demutualised and listed on the London Stock Exchange and other stock exchanges in 1999.
It introduced a new strategy, called 'managed separation', that entailed the separation of its four businesses ‚Äì Old Mutual Emerging Markets, Nedbank, UK-based Old Mutual Wealth and Boston-based Old Mutual Asset Management (OMAM) ‚Äì into standalone entities in 2018. This led to the demerger of Quilter plc (formerly 'Old Mutual Wealth') and the unbundling of its shareholding in Nedbank.
The business, which is now largely based in South Africa, provides sponsorship and supports bursaries at South African universities.


== History ==

The company was founded in 1845 as a mutual insurance company by John Fairbairn, together with several other prominent Cape Town figures, such as the liberal politician Saul Solomon.

In 1939, the Old Mutual art deco office opened in Darling Street as the Mutual Building ('Mutualgebou' in Afrikaans) which has since been converted to residential use and known as ""Mutual Heights"". In 1956, Old Mutual relocated its head office to Mutualpark in Pinelands, at that time the largest office block in the southern hemisphere."

Allianz Worldwide;Insurance;"An alliance is a relationship among people, groups, or states that have joined together for mutual benefit or to achieve some common purpose, whether or not an explicit agreement has been worked out among them. Members of an alliance are called allies. Alliances form in many settings, including political alliances, military alliances, and business alliances. When the term is used in the context of war or armed struggle, such associations may also be called allied powers, especially when discussing World War I or World War II.
A formal military alliance is not required to be perceived as an ally‚Äîco-belligerence, fighting alongside someone, is enough. According to this usage, allies become so not when concluding an alliance treaty but when struck by war.
When spelled with a capital ""A"", ""Allies"" usually denotes the countries who fought together against the Central Powers in World War; I (the Allies of World War I), or those who fought against the Axis Powers in World War II (the Allies of World War II). The term has also been used by the United States Army to describe the countries that gave assistance to South Vietnam during the Vietnam War.
The Allied Powers in World War I (also known as the Entente Powers) were initially the United Kingdom, France, the Russian Empire, Belgium, Serbia, Montenegro and Japan, joined later by Italy, Portugal, Romania, the United States, Greece and Brazil. Some, such as the Russian Empire, withdrew from the war before the armistice due to revolution or defeat.
After the end of World War II and during the Cold War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and Warsaw Pact (WP) was formed as a political and military alliance that promotes anti-communist values."

Kingfisher;Retailing;"Kingfishers are a family, the Alcedinidae, of small to medium-sized, brightly coloured birds in the order Coraciiformes. They have a cosmopolitan distribution, with most species living in the tropical regions of Africa, Asia, and Oceania, but also can be found in Europe and the Americas. They can be found in deep forests near calm ponds and small rivers. The family contains 118 species and is divided into three subfamilies and 19 genera. All kingfishers have large heads, long, sharp, pointed bills, short legs, and stubby tails. Most species have bright plumage with only small differences between the sexes. Most species are tropical in distribution, and a slight majority are found only in forests.
They consume a wide range of prey, usually caught by swooping down from a perch. While kingfishers are usually thought to live near rivers and eat fish, many species live away from water and eat small invertebrates. Like other members of their order, they nest in cavities, usually tunnels dug into the natural or artificial banks in the ground."

Tribune;Media;"Tribune (Latin: Tribunus) was the title of various elected officials in ancient Rome.  The two most important were the tribunes of the plebs and the military tribunes.  For most of Roman history, a college of ten tribunes of the plebs acted as a check on the authority of the senate and the annual magistrates, holding the power of ius intercessionis to intervene on behalf of the plebeians, and veto unfavourable legislation.  There were also military tribunes, who commanded portions of the Roman army, subordinate to higher magistrates, such as the consuls and praetors, promagistrates, and their legates.  Various officers within the Roman army were also known as tribunes.  The title was also used for several other positions and classes in the course of Roman history.


== Tribal tribunes ==
The word tribune is derived from the Roman tribes. The three original tribes known as the Ramnes or Ramnenses, Tities or Titienses, and the Luceres, were each headed by a tribune, who represented each tribe in civil, religious, and military matters.:‚Ääii. 7‚Ää  Subsequently, each of the Servian tribes was also represented by a tribune.:‚Ääii. 14‚Ää

Telenor started off in 1855, as a state-operated monopoly provider of telegraph services named Telegrafverket. The first Norwegian planning  for a telegraph were launched within the Royal Norwegian Navy in 1848, but by 1852, the plans were public and the Parliament of Norway decided on a plan for constructing a telegraph system throughout the country. Televerket began by connecting Christiania (now Oslo) to Sweden (Norway was at that time in a union with Sweden) as well as Christiania and Drammen. By 1857, the telegraph had reached Bergen on the west coast via S√∏rlandet on the south coast, and by 1871, it had reached Kirkenes on the far north coast. Cable connections were opened to Denmark in 1867 and to Great Britain in 1869."

The company's corporate headquarters, Standard Bank Centre, is located in Johannesburg, Gauteng. The bank has a presence in over 20 Sub-Saharan African countries, 4 global centers, and 2 offshore hubs, for a total of 26 countries of operation.


== History ==
The bank now known as Standard Bank was formed in 1862 as a South African subsidiary of the British overseas bank Standard Bank, under the name The Standard Bank of South Africa.
The bank's origins can be traced to 1862, when a group of businessmen led by the prominent South African politician John Paterson formed a bank in London, initially under the name Standard Bank of British South Africa. The bank started operations in 1863 in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, and soon after opening it merged with several other banks including the Commercial Bank of Port Elizabeth, the Colesberg Bank, the British Kaffrarian Bank and the Fauresmith Bank.
It was prominent in financing and development of the diamond fields of Kimberley in 1867. The word ""British"" was dropped from the title in 1883.  When gold was discovered on the Witwatersrand, the bank expanded northwards and on 11 October 1886 the bank started doing business in a tent at Ferreira's Camp (later to be called Johannesburg), thus becoming the first bank to open a branch on the Witwatersrand gold fields.

GUS;Retailing;"A gun is a device that propels a projectile using pressure or explosive force. The projectiles are typically solid, but can also be pressurized liquid (e.g. in water guns or cannons), or gas (e.g. light-gas gun).  Solid projectiles may be free-flying (as with bullets and artillery shells) or tethered (as with Tasers, spearguns and harpoon guns). A large-caliber gun is also called a cannon. Guns were designed as weapons for military use, and then found use in hunting. Now, there are guns, e.g., toy guns, water guns, paintball guns, etc., for many purposes.
The means of projectile propulsion vary according to designs, but are traditionally effected pneumatically by a high gas pressure contained within a barrel tube (gun barrel), produced either through the rapid exothermic combustion of propellants (as with firearms), or by mechanical compression (as with air guns). The high-pressure gas is introduced behind the projectile, pushing and accelerating it down the length of the tube, imparting sufficient launch velocity to sustain its further travel towards the target once the propelling gas ceases acting upon it after it exits the muzzle."

The adjective ""Generali"" (""general"") referred to the company's comprehensive insurance coverage across all the branches (fire, life, hail, sea, land and river transport). This approach was rare at the time when most Trieste insurance companies focused solely on maritime transport, except for the Azienda Assicuratrice, which also dealt with hail insurance.
The ""Austrian-Italian"" label referred to the company's dual management structure, with the main office in Trieste responsible for the company's affairs and relations with the Habsburg Monarchy, (at the time, Trieste was the most important seaport of the Austrian Empire). Meanwhile, a management office in Venice oversaw activities in Lombardy-Venetia and the Italian peninsula."

=== Origins to 2000 ===
Kyocera's original product was a ceramic insulator known as a ""kelcima"" for use in cathode-ray tubes. The company quickly adapted its technologies to produce an expanding range of ceramic components for electronic and structural applications. In the 1960s, as the NASA space program, the birth of Silicon Valley and the advancement of computer technology created demand for semiconductor integrated circuits (ICs), Kyocera developed ceramic semiconductor packages that remain among its core product lines.
In the mid-1970s, Kyocera began expanding its material technologies to produce a diverse range of applied ceramic products, including solar photovoltaic modules; biocompatible tooth- and joint-replacement systems; industrial cutting tools; consumer ceramics, such as ceramic-bladed kitchen knives and ceramic-tipped ballpoint pens; and lab-grown gemstones, including rubies, emeralds, sapphires, opals, alexandrites and padparadschahs.
The company acquired electronic equipment manufacturing and radio communication technologies in 1979 through an investment in Cybernet Electronics Corporation, which was merged into Kyocera in 1982.  Shortly afterward, Kyocera introduced one of the first portable, battery-powered laptop computers, sold in the U.S. as the Tandy Model 100, which featured an LCD screen and telephone-modem data transfer capability.
Kyocera gained optical technology by acquiring Yashica in 1983, along with Yashica's prior licensing agreement with Carl Zeiss, and manufactured film and digital cameras under the Kyocera, Yashica and Contax trade names until 2005, when the company discontinued all film and digital camera production."

Aviva;Insurance;"Aviv (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë) means ""spring (season)"" in Hebrew. Aviv is the first month of the year in the Pentateuch, and is later called Nisan in the book of Esther and in subsequent post-exilic history up to the present day. These names are sometimes used interchangeably, although Aviv refers to the three-month season, and Nisan is called the ""first month of Aviv."" Aviv is also used as a given name, surname, and place name, as in Tel Aviv.  


== Meanings ==
The basic meaning of the word aviv is the stage in the growth of grain when the seeds have reached full size and are filled with starch, but have not dried yet. During the plague of hail (Exodus 9:31), the barley was said to be [in the] aviv [stage] and the flax [in the] giv`ol. This resulted in their destruction.
The month in the Hebrew calendar when the barley has reached or passed this stage is called Aviv, or the ""month of the aviv"". This month is considered the first month of the ecclesiastical civil year (see Hebrew calendar#Months). It begins about the time of the March equinox (March 21). Since the Babylonian captivity, this month has mainly been called Nisan."

Diageo;Food drink & tobacco;"Diego is a Spanish masculine given name. The Portuguese equivalent is Diogo. The etymology of Diego is disputed, with two major origin hypotheses: Tiago and Didacus.
The name also has several patronymic derivations, listed below.


== Etymology ==


=== Tiago hypothesis ===
Diego has long been interpreted as variant of Tiago (also spelled as Thiago), an abbreviation of Santiago, from the older Sant Yago ""Saint Jacob"", in English known as Saint James or as San-Tiago (cf. San Diego). This has been the standard interpretation of the name since at least the 19th century, as it was reported by Robert Southey in 1808 and by Apolinar Rato y Hevia (1891). The suggestion that this identification may be a folk etymology, i.e. that Diego (and Didacus; see below) may be of another origin and only later identified with Jacobo, is made by Buchholtz (1894), though this possibility is judged as improbable by the author.


=== Didacus hypothesis ===
In the later 20th century, the traditional identification of Diego = Jacobo came to be seen as untenable."

Heinz ranked first in ketchup in the US with a market share in excess of 50%; the Ore-Ida label held 46% of the frozen potato sector in 2003.
Since 1896, the company used its ""57 Varieties"" slogan; it was inspired by a sign advertising 21 styles of shoes, and Henry Heinz chose the number 57 even though the company then manufactured more than 60 products, because ""5"" was his lucky number and ""7"" was his wife's.
In February 2013, Heinz agreed to be purchased by Berkshire Hathaway and the Brazilian investment firm 3G Capital for $23 billion. On March 25, 2015, Kraft announced its merger with Heinz, arranged by Berkshire Hathaway and 3G Capital. The resulting Kraft Heinz Company is the fifth largest food company in the world. Berkshire Hathaway became a majority owner of Heinz on June 18, 2015."

Matsushita Electric Indl;Consumer durables;"The Matsushita JR series was a line of 8-bit personal computers developed by Matsushita Communication Industrial Co., Ltd., a division of Matsushita Electric Industrial (now Panasonic). Based on the success of the Sharp MZ and NEC PC-8000 series, these computers aimed primarily at the home computer and educational markets during the early 1980s. 
The JR series included four computer models: the JR-100, the JR-200, the JR-300 and the JR-800.
The JR series found a strong foothold in Japanese schools, particularly the JR-200, which became a standard machine for teaching programming in BASIC.


== JR-100 ==
The JR-100 was released on November 21, 1981, with a price of 54,800 yen. It was the cheapest domestically produced personal computer at the time of its release. 
Like the Hitachi Basic Master and Sharp MZ-80, it was a low-performance, low-priced personal computer offering basic semi-graphic character based graphics, a monochrome display, and minimal sound ability. The CPU was an 8-bit Panasonic MN1800A NMOS microprocessor (compatible with the Motorola MC6802, a slightly improved version of the Motorola MC6800) running at a slow 0.89 MHz, and it came with 16 KB of RAM (expandable to 32 KB). Compared to the cheaper imported Sinclair ZX81 (38,700 yen), the larger RAM on the JR100 made it possible to create better programs. 
The computer case is angular and cream-colored, measuring 296mm wide x 154mm deep x 45mm high, being extremely compact. The green keyboard was made of rubber due to its low price, and was mockingly called the ""eraser keyboard""."

HVB-HypoVereinsbank;Banking;"HypoVereinsbank (HVB), legally registered since late 2008 as UniCredit Bank GmbH, is a significant bank in Germany headquartered in Munich. It has been part of the Milan-based UniCredit group since 2005, and fully owned by it since 2008. As a consequence, HVB is operating exclusively in Germany, where it mainly focuses on private clients business and corporate banking, customer-related capital market activities and wealth management. 
HypoVereinsbank's predecessor entities include financial institutions that played major roles in the financial history of Bavaria, including the Bavarian State Bank (1780-1971), Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank (1835-1998), Bayerische Vereinsbank (1869-1998), and Bayerische Notenbank (1875-1934). 


== History ==


=== Stand-alone bank ===
 
In 1998, Bayerische Hypotheken- und Wechsel-Bank (also known as Hypo-Bank) and Bayerische Vereinsbank merged to form Bayerische Hypo- und Vereinsbank Aktiengesellschaft, also known as HypoVereinsbank or HVB. The merger was conceived as a defensive move favored by the Bavarian authorities, against the prospect of a hostile takeover of Bayerische Vereinsbank by Deutsche Bank which had been rumored since 1996.
The new heavyweight expanded its network into Central and Eastern Europe. During the period from 2000 to 2002, HVB completed the integration of Vienna-based Bank Austria Creditanstalt (BA-CA) and created HVB Group. Within that Group, BA-CA was responsible for the CEE countries, and bought, amongst others, the Bulgarian bank Biochim, the Serbian Eksimbanka and the Romanian Banca Comerciala Ion »öiriac.
However, the 1998 merger soon turned into a financial debacle. Hypo-Bank had entered it with a large mortgage legacy and had substantial encumbrances stemming, in particular, from the allocation of mortgage loans to the new federal states."

Apache;Oil & gas operations;"The Apache ( …ô-PATCH-ee) are several Southern Athabaskan language‚Äìspeaking peoples of the Southwest, the Southern Plains and Northern Mexico. They are linguistically related to the Navajo. They migrated from the Athabascan homelands in the north into the Southwest between 1000 and 1500 CE.
Apache bands include the Chiricahua, Jicarilla, Lipan, Mescalero, Mimbre√±o, Salinero, Plains, and Western Apache (Aravaipa, Pinale√±o, Coyotero, and Tonto). Today, Apache tribes and reservations are headquartered in Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and Oklahoma, while in Mexico the Apache are settled in Sonora, Chihuahua, Coahuila and areas of Tamaulipas. Each tribe is politically autonomous.
Historically, the Apache homelands have consisted of high mountains, sheltered and watered valleys, deep canyons, deserts, and the southern Great Plains, including areas in what is now Eastern Arizona, Northern Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua) and New Mexico, West Texas, and Southern Colorado. These areas are collectively known as Apacheria.
The Apache tribes fought the invading Spanish and Mexican peoples for centuries. The first Apache raids on Sonora appear to have taken place during the late 17th century. In 19th-century confrontations during the American Indian Wars, the U.S. Army found the Apache to be fierce warriors and skillful strategists."

Northern Rock;Banking;"Northern Rock, formerly the Northern Rock Building Society, was a British bank. Based at Regent Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, Northern Rock was originally a building society. It demutualised and became Northern Rock bank in 1997, when it floated on the London Stock Exchange with the ticker symbol NRK. 
During the early 2000s the company borrowed substantially to fund mortgages, with the aim of ambitious growth, and also donated large amounts to charitable purposes and communities directly and through sponsorships. The global banking crisis beginning around 2007‚Äì08 meant that it was unable to produce income as expected from its loans, and was at risk of being unable to repay the amounts it had borrowed. The news that the bank had approached the government for support with its liquidity led within 24 hours to a public lack of confidence and concerns that savings were at risk, and the bank failed following a bank run as people rushed to withdraw their savings. It was the first British bank in 150 years to fail due to a bank run.
Unable to find a commercial buyer or secure the further government support needed, it was taken into public ownership in 2008, as an alternative to insolvency. By that point the government had extended liquidity support of tens of billions of pounds to Northern Rock. An inquiry concluded that the board had failed to properly protect the bank from the risks inherent in its strategy, or to restrain the executive directors where required, therefore although the bank had sufficient assets, it had become vulnerable.
The branch operations were eventually returned to private ownership when the branches and other retail operations were acquired by Virgin Group in 2012, being rebranded as Virgin Money the same year."

=== Pre-merger: The National Building Society ===
The National Building Society had its origins in the freehold land movement, sometimes called the ‚Äúforty shilling freeholders movement‚Äù.

Scottish & Southern;Utilities;"SSE plc (formerly Scottish and Southern Energy plc) is a multinational energy company headquartered in Perth, Scotland. It is listed on the London Stock Exchange, and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. SSE operates in the United Kingdom and Ireland.


== History ==


=== Origins ===
The company has its origins in two public sector electricity supply authorities. The former North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board was founded in 1943 to design, construct and manage hydroelectricity projects in the Highlands of Scotland, and took over further generation and distribution responsibilities on the nationalisation of the electricity industry within the United Kingdom in 1948.
The former Southern Electricity Board was created in 1948 to distribute electricity in Southern England. Whilst the Southern Electricity Board was a distribution only authority, with no power generation capacity of its own, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric board was a broader spectrum organisation, with its own generating capabilities.
Because of its history and location, the Hydro-Electric Board was responsible for most of the hydroelectric generating capacity in the United Kingdom. Both authorities were privatised in 1990/91, initially retaining their pre privatisation geographic and functional bases. The North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board became Scottish Hydro-Electric, whilst the Southern Electricity Board became Southern Electric."

Orix;Diversified financials;"Oryx ( ORR-iks) is a genus consisting of four large antelope species called oryxes.  Their pelage is pale with contrasting dark markings in the face and on the legs, and their long horns are almost straight and annulated. The exception is the scimitar oryx, which lacks dark markings on the legs, only has faint dark markings on the head, has an ochre neck, and has horns that are clearly decurved. All oryx species prefer near-desert conditions and can survive without water for long periods.
The Arabian oryx was only saved from extinction through a captive-breeding program and reintroduction to the wild. The scimitar oryx, which was listed as extinct in the wild, also relied on a captive-breeding program for its survival.


== Etymology ==
The term ""oryx"" comes from the Greek word ·ΩÑœÅœÖŒæ √≥ryx meaning ""pickaxe"", because its long and pointed horns look similar to the tool's end.  The Greek plural form is ·ΩÑœÅœÖŒ≥ŒµœÇ √≥ryges, although ""oryxes"" has been established in English. Herodotus mentions a type of gazelle in Libya called ·ΩÑœÅœÖœÇ, orus, probably related to the verb ·ΩÄœÅœçœÉœÉœâ, oruss≈ç, or ·ΩÄœÅœçœÑœÑœâ, orutt≈ç, meaning ""to dig"". White oryxes are known to dig holes in the sand."

This approach actually worked to M&I's advantage during major financial crises such as the Panic of 1893 and the stock market crash of 1929; it was one of the few major banks in Wisconsin to survive the latter. However, after selling the Madison bank in the late 19th century, it did business solely in Milwaukee for over six decades."

Cepsa;Oil & gas operations;"Hasankeyf is a town located along the Tigris, in the Hasankeyf District, Batman Province, Turkey. It was declared a natural conservation area by Turkey in 1981.
Despite local and international objections, the city and its archaeological sites have been flooded as part of the Ilƒ±su Dam project. By 1 April 2020, water levels reached an elevation of 498.2m, covering the whole town.
The town had a population of 4,329 in 2021.


== Toponymy ==
Hasankeyf was an ancient settlement that has borne many names from a variety of cultures during its history. The variety of these names is compounded by the many ways that non-Latin alphabets such as Syriac and Arabic can be transliterated. Underlying these many names is much continuity between cultures in the basic identification of the site.
The city of IlƒÅn·π£urƒÅ mentioned in the Akkadian and Northwest Semitic texts of the Mari Tablets (1800‚Äì1750 BC) may possibly be Hasankeyf, although other sites have also been proposed. By the Roman period, the fortified town was known in Latin as Cephe, Cepha or Ciphas, a name that appears to derive from the Syriac word ‹ü‹ê‹¶‹ê (kefa or kifo), meaning ""rock""."

NEC;Technology hardware & equipment;"The neck is the part of the body in many vertebrates that connects the head to the torso. It supports the weight of the head and protects the nerves that transmit sensory and motor information between the brain and the rest of the body. Additionally, the neck is highly flexible, allowing the head to turn and move in all directions. Anatomically, the human neck is divided into four compartments: vertebral, visceral, and two vascular compartments. Within these compartments, the neck houses the cervical vertebrae, the cervical portion of the spinal cord, upper parts of the respiratory and digestive tracts, endocrine glands, nerves, arteries‚Å£‚Å£ and veins. The muscles of the neck, which are separate from the compartments, form the boundaries of the neck triangles.
In anatomy, the neck is also referred to as the cervix or collum. However, when the term cervix is used alone, it often refers to the uterine cervix, the neck of the ‚Å£‚Å£uterus‚Å£‚Å£. Therefore, the adjective cervical can refer either to the neck (as in cervical vertebrae or cervical lymph nodes) or to the uterine cervix (as in cervical cap or cervical cancer).

On November 8, 2000, KeySpan acquired Eastern Enterprises, Eastern's natural gas distribution subsidiaries including Boston Gas Company, Colonial Gas Company and Essex Gas Company; Eastern's unregulated businesses including ServicEdge Partners, the largest unregulated provider of residential HVAC equipment installation and services in Massachusetts; and EnergyNorth Natural Gas in New Hampshire. It also was the operator of the Long Island Power Authority's electrical grid, which had previously been part of LILCO before LIPA took it over in 1998. KeySpan had its headquarters in Brooklyn, New York, USA and employed 9,700 people.
In February 2006, National Grid USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of National Grid plc of the United Kingdom, announced that it had agreed to buy KeySpan for $7.3 billion (¬£4.1 billion) in cash, the deal being subject to regulatory approval and endorsement by the shareholders of the two companies. In 2007 National Grid plc announced the completion of the acquisition.
KeySpan received a 100% rating on the Corporate Equality Index released by the Human Rights Campaign starting in 2004, the third year of the report.


== Brooklyn Union Gas ==
The Brooklyn Union Gas Company was originally established in 1825 as the Brooklyn Gas Light Company, changing its name after a series of mergers in 1895. Rapid growth in the early 1900s prompted the company to establish a new headquarters at 180 Remsen Street."
CSX;Transportation;"CSX Transportation (reporting mark CSXT), known colloquially as simply CSX, is a Class I freight railroad company operating in the Eastern United States and the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. Operating about 21,000 route miles (34,000 km) of track, it is the leading subsidiary of CSX Corporation, a Fortune 500 company headquartered in Jacksonville, Florida.
CSX Corporation was formed in 1980 from the merger of Chessie System and Seaboard Coast Line Industries, two holding companies that controlled railroads operating in the Eastern United States. Initially only a holding company, the subsidiaries that made up CSX Corporation completed merging in 1987. CSX Transportation formally came into existence in 1986, as the successor of Seaboard System Railroad. In 1999, CSX Transportation acquired about half of Conrail in a joint purchase with competitor Norfolk Southern Railway. In 2022, it acquired Pan Am Railways, extending its reach into northern New England.
Norfolk Southern remains CSX's chief competitor; the two share a duopoly on transcontinental freight rail lines in the east half of the US.


== History ==


=== Predecessors ===
CSX is the result of a number of mergers among railroads operating in the eastern United States, the earliest among them the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O) which formed in the 1820s. Many of the competing railroads along the east coast began merging from the 1950s onward as part of a broader trend of consolidation. An announcement from the New York Central (NYC) and Pennsylvania (PRR) railroads in November 1957 that they were considering combining set off discussions between the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) on a merger."

Natexis Banques Populaire;Banking;"Banque Populaire (French pronunciation: […° Åup b…ëÃÉk p…îpyl…õ Å], lit.‚Äâ'People's Bank') was a French group of cooperative banks, with origins in the European cooperative movement. In 2009, it merged with Groupe Caisse d'√âpargne to form Groupe BPCE. 


== History ==
Groupe Banque Populaire started in 1878 with the foundation of the first local ""people's bank"" (French: banque populaire) in the western French city of Angers. During World War I, Commerce Minister √âtienne Cl√©mentel was instrumental in passing the law of 13 March 1917 which established the local Popular Banks' cooperative status and granted them favorable financial and tax treatment, with intent to fill the void left by struggling local banks in the market for short-term lending to small businesses. In 1921, another legislative act established a central financial entity, the Caisse centrale des Banques populaires (CCBP).
In 1919, the French state sponsored the creation of Cr√©dit National, a specialized bank. In 1946, the French state created Compagnie Fran√ßaise d'Assurance pour le Commerce Ext√©rieur (Coface), a trade credit insurer, and Banque Fran√ßaise du Commerce Ext√©rieur (BFCE), a specialized bank providing export financing services. In 1974, the Social Assistance Bank of the National Education Ministry (French: Caisse d'aide sociale de l'√âducation nationale, CASDEN) joined the Banque Populaire network, later rebranding as CASDEN Banque populaire. In 1996, Cr√©dit National purchased BFCE, and the merged entity renamed itself as Natexis, in which natex is a portmanteau of national and ext√©rieur.
The CCBP purchased Natexis in 1998, and renamed it Natexis Banques Populaires. In 1999, the CCBP was replaced by a new banking entity, the Banque f√©d√©rale des banques populaires (BFBP)."

BAA;Transportation;"Bats are flying mammals of the order Chiroptera (). With their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight. Bats are more agile in flight than most birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29‚Äì34 mm (1.1‚Äì1.3 in) in length, 150 mm (5.9 in) across the wings and 2‚Äì2.6 g (0.071‚Äì0.092 oz) in mass. The largest bats are the flying foxes, with the giant golden-crowned flying fox (Acerodon jubatus) reaching a weight of 1.6 kg (3.5 lb) and having a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in).
The second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400 species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats. Many bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or nectarivores (nectar-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood."
Bunge;Food drink & tobacco;"A stopper, bung, or  cork  is a cylindrical or conical closure used to seal a container, such as a bottle, tube, or barrel. 


== Description ==
Unlike a lid or bottle cap, which encloses a container from the outside without displacing the inner volume, a bung is partially or wholly inserted inside the container to act as a seal. A bung can be defined as ""a plug or closure used to close an opening in a drum or barrel. It is called a plug when referring to a steel drum closure.""
A glass stopper is often called a ""ground glass joint"" (or ""joint taper""), and a cork stopper is called simply a ""cork"". Stoppers used for wine bottles are referred to as ""corks"", even when made from another material. 
A common every-day example of a stopper is the cork of a wine bottle. When used to seal the bungholes of barrels, the stopper is called a bung.  Other bungs, particularly those used in chemical barrels, may be made of metal and be screwed into place via threading. 


== Ground glass joint ==

Ground glass joint (or ground glass stoppers) are commonly used with laboratory glassware, mainly because of their nonreactivity. Some stoppers used in labs have holes in them to allow the insertion of glass or rubber tubing."

Daiei;Retailing;"A dairy is a place where milk is stored and where butter, cheese, and other dairy products are made, or a place where those products are sold.:‚Ää325‚Ää:‚Ää284‚Ää It may be a room, a building, or a larger establishment.:‚Ää284‚Ää In the United States, the word may also describe a dairy farm or the part of a mixed farm dedicated to milk for human consumption,:‚Ää284‚Ää whether from cows, buffaloes, goats, yaks, sheep, horses or camels.
The attributive dairy describes milk-based products, derivatives, and processes, and the animals and workers involved in their production, for example dairyman, dairymaid, dairy cattle or dairy goat. A dairy farm produces milk and a dairy factory processes it into a variety of dairy products. These establishments constitute the global dairy industry, part of the food industry.
The word dairy comes from an Old English word for female servant, as milking was historically done by dairymaids.


== Terminology ==
Terminology differs between countries. In the United States, for example, an entire dairy farm is commonly called a ""dairy"". The building or farm area where milk is harvested from the cow is often called a ""milking parlor"" or ""parlor"", except in the case of smaller dairies, where cows are often put on pasture, and usually milked in ""stanchion barns"". The farm area where milk is stored in bulk tanks is known as the farm's ""milk house"". Milk is then hauled (usually by truck) to a ""dairy plant"", also referred to as a ""dairy"", where raw milk is further processed and prepared for commercial sale of dairy products."

Vattenfall Europe;Utilities;"Vattenfall is a Swedish multinational power company owned by the Swedish state. Beyond Sweden, the company generates power in Denmark, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and the United Kingdom.
The company's name is Swedish for ""waterfall"", and is an abbreviation of its original name, Royal Waterfall Board (Kungliga Vattenfallsstyrelsen).


== History ==
Vattenfall (then called Kungliga Vattenfallsstyrelsen or Royal Waterfall Board) was founded in 1909 as a state-owned enterprise in Sweden. From its founding until the mid-1970s, Vattenfall's business was largely restricted to Sweden, with a focus on hydroelectric power generation. Only in 1974 did the company begin to build nuclear reactors in Sweden (the Ringhals 1 and 2 reactors), eventually owning seven of Sweden's 12 reactors. In 1992, Vattenfall was reformed as the joint-stock company Vattenfall AB. At the same time, the transmission grid (220 kV and 400 kV lines) was transferred to the newly formed state agency Svenska kraftn√§t, which also became responsible for the operation of the national power system.
In the years 1990 through 2009, Vattenfall expanded considerably (especially into Germany, Poland and the Netherlands), acquiring stakes in H√§meen S√§hk√∂ (1996), HEW (1999, 25.1% stake from the city of Hamburg), the Polish heat production company EW (2000, 55% stake), the Danish Elsam A/S (2005, 35.3% stake), and Nuon (2009, 49% stake, today 100%). In 2002, Vattenfall AB and its acquisitions were incorporated as Vattenfall Europe AG, making it the third-largest electricity producer in Germany.
Following the expansion period, Vattenfall started to divest parts of its business in Denmark and Poland during the years following 2009 in a strategy to focus on three core markets: Sweden, Netherlands, and Germany."

Whirlpool;Consumer durables;"A whirlpool is a body of rotating water produced by opposing currents or a current running into an obstacle. Small whirlpools form when a bath or a sink is draining. More powerful ones formed in seas or oceans may be called maelstroms ( MAYL-strom, -‚Å†str…ôm). Vortex is the proper term for a whirlpool that has a downdraft.
In narrow ocean straits with fast flowing water, whirlpools are often caused by tides. Many stories tell of ships being sucked into a maelstrom, although only smaller craft are actually in danger. Smaller whirlpools appear at river rapids and can be observed downstream of artificial structures such as weirs and dams. Large cataracts, such as Niagara Falls, produce strong whirlpools.

Thales;Aerospace & defense;"Thales of Miletus ( THAY-leez; Ancient Greek: ŒòŒ±Œª·øÜœÇ; c.‚Äâ626/623  ‚Äì c.‚Äâ548/545 BC) was an Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher from Miletus in Ionia, Asia Minor. Thales was one of the Seven Sages, founding figures of Ancient Greece.
Beginning in eighteenth-century historiography, many came to regard him as the first philosopher in the Greek tradition, breaking from the prior use of mythology to explain the world and instead using natural philosophy. He is thus otherwise referred to as the first to have engaged in mathematics, science, and deductive reasoning.
Thales's view that all of nature is based on the existence of a single ultimate substance, which he theorized to be water, was widely influential among the philosophers of his time. Thales thought the Earth floated on water.
In mathematics, Thales is the namesake of Thales's theorem, and the intercept theorem can also be referred to as Thales's theorem. Thales was said to have calculated the heights of the pyramids and the distance of ships from the shore. In science, Thales was an astronomer who reportedly predicted the weather and a solar eclipse. The discovery of the position of the constellation Ursa Major is also attributed to Thales, as well as the timings of the solstices and equinoxes."

With the full acquisition of Cameron Health in June 2012, the company also became notable for offering a minimally invasive implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) which they call the EMBLEM subcutaneous implantable defibrillator (S-ICD).


== History ==
Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979, in Watertown, Massachusetts, as a holding company for the medical products company, Medi-Tech, Inc., and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine. Medi-Tech was the brainchild of Itzhak Bentov, a Czech-born √©migr√© to Israel and then to the United States, who worked at the Arthur D. Little think tank in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and ran a contract research company from his rented house in Belmont, Massachusetts, a venture he founded in 1965 with a business friend, Dan Singer. In 1967 he was asked by Boston Beth Israel Hospital radiologists to design a steerable, remotely controlled catheter; a series of engineering designs, polymer improvements and prototypes led to the release of a new steerable angiography catheter in 1969. That year John Abele joined the small company with an option to buy, and a year later he exercised his option with Cooper Labs as a business partner, and the operation was moved ‚Äì out of Bentov's lab in the basement of the rectory of a Catholic church in Belmont ‚Äì to Watertown. After a decade of steady growth, by chance Abele met Pete Nicholas in their neighborhood in Concord, Massachusetts. Their partnership hinged on Nicholas' goal to build business enterprises and Abele's predilection for the vision and potential in noninvasive surgical instrumentation; they gathered backers in the Boston banking community to buy out the Cooper Labs interest and form the new corporation.
Less than a year later Kimray Medical Associates (later Mansfield Scientific, Inc.) was acquired, adding vena cava filters and cardiac output computers to the product line."

DSM;Chemicals;"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM; latest edition: DSM-5-TR, published in March 2022) is a publication by the American Psychiatric Association (APA) for the classification of mental disorders using a common language and standard criteria. It is an internationally accepted manual on the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders, though it may be used in conjunction with other documents. Other commonly used principal guides of psychiatry include the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD), and the Psychodynamic Diagnostic Manual. However, not all providers rely on the DSM-5 as a guide, since the ICD's mental disorder diagnoses are used around the world, and scientific studies often measure changes in symptom scale scores rather than changes in DSM-5 criteria to determine the real-world effects of mental health interventions.
It is used by researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policymakers. Some mental health professionals use the manual to determine and help communicate a patient's diagnosis after an evaluation. Hospitals, clinics, and insurance companies in the United States may require a DSM diagnosis for all patients with mental disorders.  Health-care researchers use the DSM to categorize patients for research purposes.
The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, as well as from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, while removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders."

Production of Tyrian purple for use as a fabric dye began as early as 1200 BC by the Phoenicians, and was continued by the Greeks and Romans until 1453 AD, with the fall of Constantinople. In the same way as the modern-day Latin alphabet of Phoenician origin, Phoenician purple pigment was spread through the unique Phoenician trading empire.

Electronic Data Sys;Software & services;"Commerce is the organized system of activities, functions, procedures and institutions that directly or indirectly contribute to the smooth, unhindered large-scale distribution and transfer (exchange through buying and selling) of goods and services at the right time, place, quantity, quality and price through various channels among the original producers and the final consumers within local, regional, national or international economies. The diversity in the distribution of natural resources, differences of human needs and wants, and division of labour along with comparative advantage are the principal factors that give rise to commercial exchanges.
Commerce consists of trade and aids to trade (i.e. auxiliary commercial services) taking place along the entire supply chain. Trade is the exchange of goods (including raw materials, intermediate and finished goods) and services between buyers and sellers in return for an agreed-upon price at traditional (or online) marketplaces. It is categorized into domestic trade, including retail and wholesale as well as local, regional, inter-regional and international/foreign trade (encompassing import, export and entrep√¥t/re-export trades). The exchange of currencies (in foreign exchange markets), commodities (in commodity markets/exchanges) and securities and derivatives (in stock exchanges and financial markets) in specialized exchange markets, typically operating under the domain of finance and investment, also falls under the umbrella of trade. On the other hand, auxiliary commercial activities (aids to trade) which can facilitate trade include commercial intermediaries, banking, credit financing and related services, transportation, packaging, warehousing, communication, advertising and insurance. Their purpose is to remove hindrances related to direct personal contact, payments, savings, funding, separation of place and time, product protection and preservation, knowledge and risk.
The broader framework of commerce incorporates additional elements and factors such as laws and regulations (including intellectual property rights and antitrust laws), policies, tariffs and trade barriers, consumers and consumer trends, producers and production strategies, supply chains and their management, financial transactions for ordinary and extraordinary business activities, market dynamics (including supply and demand), technological innovation, competition and entrepreneurship, trade agreements, multinational corporations and small and medium-sized enterprisess (SMEs), and macroeconomic factors (like economic stability)."

Fuji Heavy Inds;Consumer durables;"Lights-out manufacturing or dark factory is the manufacturing methodology of fully automating the production of goods at factories and other industrial facilities, without requiring any human labour presence on-site. Many of these factories are considered to be able to run ""with the lights off,"" but few run exclusively lights-out production. For example, in computer numerical control machining, the presence of human workers is typically required for removing completed parts and setting up tombstones that hold unfinished parts. As the technology necessary for total automation becomes increasingly available, many factories are beginning to use lights-out production between shifts (or as a separate shift) to meet increasing production demand or to save money on labor.
An automatic factory is a place where raw materials enter, and finished products leave with little or no human intervention.  One of the earliest descriptions of the automatic factory in fiction was the 1955 short story ""Autofac,"" by Philip K. Dick.


== Real-world examples ==


=== ""Lights out"" computer numerical control (CNC) machining ===
CNC machines do not require continuous operator attention, and some models can run unattended. A few machine shops run CNC unattended on nights and weekends. Although the machines are run without being under constant supervision, it is a common practice to always have a person in the vicinity of the machine.

=== Founding (1868 ‚Äì 1874) ===

Union and Planters Bank was founded by William Farrington, a Memphis businessman who had prospered during the American Civil War and emerged the wealthy head of an insurance company. In 1868, Farrington and the Board of Directors of Desoto Insurance Company applied to convert the company to a bank and they received government approval on February 12, 1869. Prior to the Civil War, the two most prominent banks in Memphis were Union Bank and the Branch Planters Bank. The assets of both, however, were seized during the war and the two banks had ceased to exist.

Public Power;Utilities;"In political science, power is the ability to influence or direct the actions, beliefs, or conduct of actors. Power does not exclusively refer to the threat or use of force (coercion) by one actor against another, but may also be exerted through diffuse means (such as institutions). 
Power may also take structural forms, as it orders actors in relation to one another (such as distinguishing between a master and an enslaved person, a householder and their relatives, an employer and their employees, a parent and a child, a political representative and their voters, etc.), and discursive forms, as categories and language may lend legitimacy to some behaviors and groups over others.
The term authority is often used for power that is perceived as legitimate or socially approved by the social structure.
Scholars have distinguished between soft power and hard power.


== Theories ==


=== Five bases of power ===

In a now-classic study (1959), social psychologists John R. P. French and Bertram Raven developed a schema of sources of power by which to analyse how power plays work (or fail to work) in a specific relationship.
According to French and Raven, power must be distinguished from influence in the following way: power is that state of affairs that holds in a given relationship, A-B, such that a given influence attempt by A over B makes A's desired change in B more likely. Conceived this way, power is fundamentally relative; it depends on the specific understandings A and B each apply to their relationship and requires B's recognition of a quality in A that would motivate B to change in the way A intends. A must draw on the 'base' or combination of bases of power appropriate to the relationship to effect the desired outcome. Drawing on the wrong power base can have unintended effects, including a reduction in A's own power."
Autostrade;Transportation;"The autostrade (Italian: [ÀåautoÀàstraÀêde]; sg.: autostrada, Italian: [ÀåautoÀàstraÀêda]) are roads forming the Italian national system of motorways. The total length of the system is about 7,016 kilometres (4,360 mi), as of 30 July 2022. There are also 13 motorway spur routes, which extend for 355 kilometres (221 mi).
Most of the Italian motorways have two lanes per carriageway, but 1,870.2 kilometres (1,162.1 mi) of the Italian motorway network have three lanes per carriageway, 129 kilometres (80 mi) have four lanes per carriageway, and only 1.8 kilometres (1.1 mi) have five lanes per carriageway. The density is of 22.4 kilometres (13.9 mi) of motorway for every 1,000 square kilometres (390 sq mi) of Italian territory.
Italy was the first country in the world to build motorways reserved for fast traffic and motor vehicles only. The Autostrada dei Laghi  ('Lakes Motorway'), the first built in the world, connecting Milan to Lake Como and Lake Maggiore, and now forms the A8 and A9 motorways, was devised by Piero Puricelli and inaugurated in 1924.
In northern and central Italy and in the southern regions of Campania and Apulia, the autostrade mainly consist of tollways managed by Autostrade per l'Italia, a holding company controlled by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. Other operators include ASTM, ATP, and Autostrade Lombarde in the north-west; Autostrada del Brennero, A4 Holding, Concessioni Autostradali Venete, and Autovie Venete in the north-east; Strada dei Parchi, SALT, SAT, and Autocisa in the center; and CAS in Sicily.

The company was founded in 1947 in New York by Rupert H. (Harris) Johnson Sr. (1900‚Äì1989), who ran a successful retail brokerage firm from an office on Wall Street. He named the company for American polymath Benjamin Franklin because Franklin espoused frugality and prudence when it came to saving and investing. The company's first line of mutual funds, Franklin Custodian Funds, was a series of conservatively managed equity and bond funds designed to appeal to most investors.
After Rupert Sr. retired, his son, Charles B. Johnson (Charlie), took over as president and chief executive officer in 1957 at age 24."
Sumitomo Metal Inds;Materials;"The Nikkei 225, or the Nikkei Stock Average (Japanese: Êó•ÁµåÂπ≥ÂùáÊ†™‰æ°, Hepburn: Nikkei heikin kabuka), more commonly called the Nikkei or the Nikkei index (), is a stock market index for the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).  It is a price-weighted index, operating in the Japanese Yen (JP¬•), and its components are reviewed twice a year. The Nikkei 225 measures the performance of 225 highly capitalised and liquid publicly owned companies in Japan from a wide array of industry sectors. Since 2017, the index is calculated every five seconds. It was originally launched by the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1950, and was taken over by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun (The Nikkei) newspaper in 1970, when the Tokyo Exchange switched to the Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), which is weighed by market capitalisation rather than stock prices.


== History ==
The Nikkei 225 began to be calculated on 7 September 1950, retroactively calculated back to 16 May 1949, when the average price of its component stocks was 176.21 yen. Since July 2017, the index is updated every 5 seconds during trading sessions.
The Nikkei 225 Futures, introduced at Singapore Exchange (SGX) in 1986, the Osaka Securities Exchange (OSE) in 1988, Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) in 1990, is now an internationally recognized futures index.
The Nikkei average has deviated sharply from the textbook model of stock averages, which grow at a steady exponential rate. During the Japanese asset price bubble, the average hit its bubble-era record high on 29 December 1989, when it reached an intraday high of 38,957.44, before closing at 38,915.87, having grown sixfold during the decade."

Rohm;Semiconductors;"The Night of the Long Knives (German: Nacht der langen Messer, pronounced [Àànaxt deÀê…êÃØ Ààla≈ã…ôn Ààm…õs…ê] ), also called the R√∂hm purge or Operation Hummingbird (German: Aktion Kolibri), was a purge that took place in Nazi Germany from 30 June to 2 July 1934. Chancellor Adolf Hitler, urged on by Hermann G√∂ring and Heinrich Himmler, ordered a series of political extrajudicial executions intended to consolidate his power and alleviate the concerns of the German military about the role of Ernst R√∂hm and the Sturmabteilung (SA), the Nazis' paramilitary organization, known colloquially as ""Brownshirts"". Nazi propaganda presented the murders as a preventive measure against an alleged imminent coup by the SA under R√∂hm ‚Äì the so-called R√∂hm Putsch.
The primary instruments of Hitler's action were the Schutzstaffel (SS) paramilitary force under Himmler and its Security Service (SD), and Gestapo (secret police) under Reinhard Heydrich, which between them carried out most of the killings. G√∂ring's personal police battalion also took part. Many of those killed in the purge were leaders of the SA, the best-known being R√∂hm himself, the SA's chief of staff and one of Hitler's longtime supporters and allies. Leading members of the Strasserist faction of the Nazi Party, including its leader Gregor Strasser, were also killed, as were establishment conservatives and anti-Nazis, such as former Chancellor Kurt von Schleicher and Bavarian politician Gustav Ritter von Kahr, who had helped suppress Hitler's Munich Beer Hall Putsch in 1923. The murders of SA leaders were also intended to improve the image of the Hitler government with a German public that was increasingly critical of thuggish SA tactics.
Hitler saw the independence of the SA and the penchant of its members for street violence as a direct threat to his newly gained political power. He also wanted to appease leaders of the Reichswehr, the German military, who feared and despised the SA as a potential rival, in particular because of R√∂hm's ambition to merge the army and the SA under his own leadership."

== Name ==
Lucent means ""light-bearing"" in Latin. The name was applied for in 1996 at the time of the split from AT&T.
The name was widely criticised, as the logo was to be, both internally and externally. Corporate communications and business cards included the strapline 'Bell Labs Innovations' in a bid to retain the prestige of the internationally famous research lab, within a new business under an as-yet unknown name.
This same linguistic root also gives Lucifer, ""the light bearer"" (from lux, 'light', and ferre, 'to bear'), who is also a character in Dante's epic poem Inferno. Shortly after the Lucent renaming in 1996, Lucent's Plan 9 project released a development of their work as the Inferno OS in 1997. This extended the 'Lucifer' and Dante references as a series of punning names for the components of Inferno - Dis, Limbo, Charon and Styx (9P Protocol)."

Delphi;Consumer durables;"Delhi, officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, the capital of India. Straddling the Yamuna river, but spread chiefly to the west, or beyond its right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the remaining directions. Delhi became a union territory on 1 November 1956 and the NCT in 1995. The NCT covers an area of 1,484 square kilometres (573 sq mi).

Seiko Epson;Technology hardware & equipment;"Epsom is a town in the borough of Epsom and Ewell in Surrey, England, about 14 miles (22 kilometres) south of central London. The town is first recorded as Ebesham in the 10th century and its name probably derives from that of a Saxon landowner. The earliest evidence of human activity is from the mid-Bronze Age, but the modern settlement probably grew up in the area surrounding St Martin's Church in the 6th or 7th centuries and the street pattern is thought to have become established in the Middle Ages. Today the High Street is dominated by the clock tower, which was erected in 1847‚Äì8.
Like other nearby settlements, Epsom is located on the spring line where the permeable chalk of the North Downs meets the impermeable London Clay. Several tributaries of the Hogsmill River rise in the town and in the 17th and early 18th centuries, the spring on Epsom Common was believed to have healing qualities. The mineral waters were found to be rich in Epsom salts, which were later identified as magnesium sulphate. Charles II was among those who regularly took the waters and several prominent writers, including John Aubrey, Samuel Pepys and Celia Fiennes recorded their visits. The popularity of the spa declined rapidly in the 1720s as a result of competition from other towns, including Bath and Tunbridge Wells.
Organised horse racing on Epsom Downs is believed to have taken place since the early 17th century."

Bradford & Bingley;Diversified financials;"Bradford & Bingley plc was a British bank with headquarters in the West Yorkshire town of Bingley.
The bank was formed in December 2000 by demutualisation of the Bradford & Bingley Building Society following a vote of the building society's members, who swapped their nominal share of the building society for at least 250 shares of the newly formed bank.
In 2008, partly due to the credit crunch, the bank was nationalised and in effect split into two parts; the mortgage book and investment portfolios remained with the now publicly owned Bradford & Bingley plc, and the deposits and branch network (and a licence to use the B&B name for those aspects) was sold to Abbey National, itself owned by the Spanish Santander Group. The branch network was rebranded Santander on 11 January 2010 and the Bradford & Bingley name mainly relates to the nationalised section of the bank. From 2010, the brand has been used under licence for insurance products by BGL Group.

There had been a move towards consolidation in the industry which had as many as 681 societies. In 1963 Bingley made the approach and the merger was effected with the understanding that there would be complete parity of control.  Although Bingley BS had the larger number of branches (29 v 23) it was smaller by assets compared to the Bradford EBS (¬£43m v ¬£56m). The Head Office was to be at Bingley; Bradford EBS had the President and Bingley BS the Vice President; and there were Joint Managing Directors."

The largest fast fashion group in the world, it operates over 7,200 stores in 93 markets worldwide. The company's flagship brand is Zara, but it also owns a number of other brands including Zara Home, Bershka, Massimo Dutti, Oysho, Pull&Bear, Stradivarius, Uterq√ºe and Lefties. The majority of its stores are corporate-owned, while franchises are mainly conceded in countries where corporate properties cannot be foreign-owned.
Inditex's business is centred around one simple premise ‚Äì to be quick at responding to the market. Whereas it would take almost a year for a traditional fashion company to get its products out, from conception to runway to stores, for Inditex, this process takes less than two months to replenish stores with new and different products weekly and respond quickly.  In Zara stores, it can take a new garment as little as 15 days to go from design and production to store shelves.
The Uyghur Rights Monitor, Sheffield Hallam University, and the Uyghur Center for Democracy and Human Rights have accused the company of using Uyghur forced labour through the Chinese based textile supplier Beijing Guanghua textile group.

AES;Utilities;"The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), also known by its original name Rijndael (Dutch pronunciation: [Ààr…õindaÀêl]), is a specification for the encryption of electronic data established by the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 2001.
AES is a variant of the Rijndael block cipher developed by two Belgian cryptographers, Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, who submitted a proposal to NIST during the AES selection process. Rijndael is a family of ciphers with different key and block sizes. For AES, NIST selected three members of the Rijndael family, each with a block size of 128 bits, but three different key lengths: 128, 192 and 256 bits.
AES has been adopted by the U.S. government. It supersedes the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was published in 1977. The algorithm described by AES is a symmetric-key algorithm, meaning the same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting the data.
In the United States, AES was announced by the NIST as U.S. FIPS PUB 197 (FIPS 197) on November 26, 2001. This announcement followed a five-year standardization process in which fifteen competing designs were presented and evaluated, before the Rijndael cipher was selected as the most suitable.
AES is included in the ISO/IEC 18033-3 standard."

== History ==

North Fork early history was dominated by mergers of banks on the North Fork, Suffolk County, New York. Its earliest component was Southold Savings Bank in Southold, New York (although the company dates its history from 1905 with the founding of Mattituck Bank in Mattituck, New York, which would become the most active early partner).
It first assumed the name of North Fork Bank & Trust Company in 1950 through the consolidation of Mattituck and First National Bank of Cutchogue in Cutchogue, New York. North Fork Bancorporation was formed in 1980 and Southold Savings was acquired in 1988.

Flextronics Intl;Business services & supplies;"Ireland's Corporate Tax System is a central component of Ireland's economy.  In 2016‚Äì17, foreign firms paid 80% of Irish corporate tax, employed 25% of the Irish labour force (paid 50% of Irish salary tax), and created 57% of Irish OECD non-farm value-add.  As of 2017, 25 of the top 50 Irish firms were U.S.‚Äìcontrolled businesses, representing 70% of the revenue of the top 50 Irish firms.  By 2018, Ireland had received the most U.S. ¬ß Corporate tax inversions in history, and Apple was over one‚Äìfifth of Irish GDP. Academics rank Ireland as the largest tax haven; larger than the Caribbean tax haven system.
Ireland's ""headline"" corporation tax rate is 12.5%, however, foreign multinationals pay an aggregate ¬ß Effective tax rate (ETR) of 2.2‚Äì4.5% on global profits ""shifted"" to Ireland, via Ireland's global network of bilateral tax treaties.  These lower effective tax rates are achieved by a complex set of Irish base erosion and profit shifting (""BEPS"") tools which handle the largest BEPS flows in the world (e.g. the Double Irish as used by Google and Facebook, the Single Malt as used by Microsoft and Allergan, and Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets as used by Accenture, and by Apple post Q1 2015).
Ireland's main ¬ß Multinational tax schemes use ""intellectual property"" (""IP"") accounting to affect the BEPS movement, which is why almost all foreign multinationals in Ireland are from the industries with substantial IP, namely technology and life sciences.

Ireland's GDP is artificially inflated by BEPS accounting flows.  This distortion escalated in Q1 2015 when Apple executed the largest BEPS transaction in history, on-shoring $300 billion of non‚ÄìU.S. IP to Ireland (resulting in a phenomenon dubbed by some as ""leprechaun economics"")."

(SPS) dates its origins to 1904 and the Pecos Valley in New Mexico when Maynard Gunsell received an electricity franchise for the city of Roswell, New Mexico and its 2,000 residents. The financial strain of creating this new enterprise soon overwhelmed him and he sold the franchise to W.H. Gillenwater, who named his utility the Roswell Electric Light Co. He later sold the company to an investment firm in Cleveland, Ohio, which already owned the Roswell Gas Co."

=== 2008 Foreign exchange losses controversy ===
In October 2008, the chairman Larry Yung disclosed that the firm lost HK$15 billion (US$2 billion) due to ""unauthorized trades"". The unauthorised trades were hedges with a contract value of A$9 billion against the Australian dollar, taken out to cover against a A$1.6 billion prospective acquisition and capital expenditure.

Born in Bitch≈´ Province (modern-day Okayama, Okayama), Eisai was ordained as a monk in the Tendai sect.

Bingham Copper Company (later Kennecott Utah Copper)
Salt Lake and Los Angeles Railroad Company (now Union Pacific Railroad)
Big Cottonwood Power Company (later Utah Power and today Rocky Mountain Power)
Salt Lake Gas Company (later Mountain Fuel Supply Company and today Questar Gas)

Humana;Health care equipment & services;"Humans (Homo sapiens) or modern humans are the most common and widespread species of primate, and the last surviving species of the genus Homo. They are great apes characterized by their hairlessness, bipedalism, and high intelligence. Humans have large brains, enabling more advanced cognitive skills that facilitate successful adaptation to varied environments, development of sophisticated tools, and formation of complex social structures and civilizations. 
Humans are highly social, with individual humans tending to belong to a multi-layered network of distinct social groups ‚Äî from families and peer groups to corporations and political states. As such, social interactions between humans have established a wide variety of values, social norms, languages, and traditions (collectively termed institutions), each of which bolsters human society. Humans are also highly curious: the desire to understand and influence phenomena has motivated humanity's development of science, technology, philosophy, mythology, religion, and other frameworks of knowledge; humans also study themselves through such domains as anthropology, social science, history, psychology, and medicine. As of 2025, there are estimated to be more than 8 billion humans alive.
For most of their history, humans were nomadic hunter-gatherers. Humans began exhibiting behavioral modernity about 160,000‚Äì60,000 years ago. The Neolithic Revolution occurred independently in multiple locations, the earliest in Southwest Asia 13,000 years ago, and saw the emergence of agriculture and permanent human settlement; in turn, this led to the development of civilization and kickstarted a period of continuous (and ongoing) population growth and rapid technological change."
Anglo Irish Bank;Banking;"Anglo Irish Bank was an Irish bank headquartered in Dublin from 1964 to 2011. It began to wind down after nationalisation in 2009. In July 2011 Anglo Irish merged with the Irish Nationwide Building Society, forming a new company named the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. Michael Noonan, the Minister for Finance stated that the name change was important in order to remove ""the negative international references associated with the appalling failings of both institutions and their previous managements"".
Anglo Irish mainly dealt in business and commercial banking, and had only a limited retail presence in the major Irish cities. It also had wealth management and treasury divisions. Anglo Irish had operations in Austria, Switzerland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
The bank's heavy exposure to property lending, with most of its loan book being to builders and property developers, meant that it was badly affected by the downturn in the Irish property market in 2008. In December 2008, the Irish government announced plans to inject ‚Ç¨1.5 billion of capital for a 75% stake in the bank, effectively nationalising it. The Dublin and London Stock Exchanges immediately suspended trading in Anglo Irish's shares, with the final closing share price of ‚Ç¨0.22 representing a fall of over 98% from its peak."

Dover;Conglomerates;"The Notrim (Hebrew: ◊†◊ï◊ò◊®◊ô◊ù, lit.‚Äâ'Guards'; singular: Noter) were mostly Jewish auxiliaries, mainly police, set up in 1936 by the British in Mandatory Palestine during the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt. The British authorities maintained, financed and armed the Notrim until the end of the Mandate in 1948. The Notrim were nominally answerable to the Palestine Police Force, but were in fact controlled by the Haganah. 


== Jewish units during the Arab Revolt (1936‚Äì39) ==
During the Arab revolt, the British Mandate authorities needed local manpower specifically to help with defending the borders of Mandatory Palestine from guerrilla infiltrators coming from French-ruled Syria and Lebanon, and to protect the Iraq Petroleum pipeline crossing northern Palestine to the port of Haifa. Once equipped and trained, the Notrim units helped protect Jewish lives and property. The Hebrew term was used collectively for members of any of three Jewish organisations authorised by the British: the largest was the highly mobile Jewish Settlement Police, followed by the ghafirs or Supernumerary Police, a lightly armed Jewish ""militia-police"", and by guides for the British army patrols. Members were recruited almost entirely from the Jewish underground militia, the Haganah. The ghafir (also spelled ghaffir) concept was not new; first set up as locally organised village guards in brigand-infested Egypt of the 19th century, they were adopted into a new national police under Lord Kitchener, provided with weapons, trained and paid by the government to whom they answered, while also remaining under the command of the local community leadership.
As notrim thousands of young men had their first experience of military training, which Moshe Shertok and Eliyahu Golomb cited as one of the fruits of the Haganah's policy of havlagah (restraint).

On 6 August 1940 Anthony Eden, the British War Secretary, informed Parliament that the Cabinet had decided to recruit Arab and Jewish units as battalions of the Royal East Kent Regiment (the ""Buffs"")."

Pearson;Media;"A person (pl.: people or persons, depending on context) is a being who has certain capacities or attributes such as reason, morality, consciousness or self-consciousness, and being a part of a culturally established form of social relations such as kinship, ownership of property, or legal responsibility. The defining features of personhood and, consequently, what makes a person count as a person, differ widely among cultures and contexts.
In addition to the question of personhood, of what makes a being count as a person to begin with, there are further questions about personal identity and self: both about what makes any particular person that particular person instead of another, and about what makes a person at one time the same person as they were or will be at another time despite any intervening changes.
The plural form ""people"" is often used to refer to an entire nation or ethnic group (as in ""a people""), and this was the original meaning of the word; it subsequently acquired its use as a plural form of person. The plural form ""persons"" is often used in philosophical and legal writing.


== Personhood ==

The criteria for being a person... are designed to capture those attributes which are the subject of our most humane concern with ourselves and the source of what we regard as most important and most problematical in our lives.
Personhood is the status of being a person. Defining personhood is a controversial topic in philosophy and law, and is closely tied to legal and political concepts of citizenship, equality, and liberty. According to common worldwide general legal practice, only a natural person or legal personality has rights, protections, privileges, responsibilities, and legal liability."
Energy East;Utilities;"The Energy East pipeline was a proposed oil pipeline in Canada. It would have delivered diluted bitumen from Western Canada and North Western United States to Eastern Canada, from receipt points in Alberta, Saskatchewan and North Dakota to refineries and port terminals in New Brunswick and possibly Quebec. The TC PipeLines project would have converted about 3,000 kilometres (1,900 mi) of natural gas pipeline, which currently carries natural gas from Alberta to the Ontario-Quebec border, to diluted bitumen transportation. New pipeline, pump stations, and tank facilities also would have been constructed. The CA$12 billion pipeline would have been the longest in North America when complete.
The project was announced publicly on August 1, 2013, while the Keystone XL pipeline proposal was being debated. In October 2014, TransCanada Pipelines filed its formal project application with the National Energy Board. At the same time a number of groups announced their intention to oppose the pipeline. The project was cancelled on October 5, 2017 by TransCanada.

SPX;Conglomerates;"Space is a three-dimensional continuum containing positions and directions. In classical physics, physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions. Modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.
In the 19th and 20th centuries mathematicians began to examine geometries that are non-Euclidean, in which space is conceived as curved, rather than flat, as in the Euclidean space. According to Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, space around gravitational fields deviates from Euclidean space. Experimental tests of general relativity have confirmed that non-Euclidean geometries provide a better model for the shape of space.


== Philosophy of space ==
Debates concerning the nature, essence and the mode of existence of space date back to antiquity; namely, to treatises like the Timaeus of Plato, or Socrates in his reflections on what the Greeks called kh√¥ra (i.e. ""space""), or in the Physics of Aristotle (Book IV, Delta) in the definition of topos (i.e."

Canadian Natural Res;Oil & gas operations;"Res gestae (Latin: ""things done"") is a term found in substantive and procedural American jurisprudence and English law. In American substantive law, it refers to the period of a felony from start-to-end. In American procedural law, it refers to a former exception to the hearsay rule for statements made spontaneously or as part of an act. The English and Canadian version of res gestae is similar, but is still recognized as a traditional exception to the hearsay rule.


== Res gestae in American substantive law ==
In certain felony murder statutes, res gestae is a term defining the overall start-to-end sequence of the underlying felony.  Generally, a felony's res gestae is considered terminated when the suspect has achieved a position of relative safety from law enforcement.


== Res gestae in American hearsay law ==

Under the Federal Rules of Evidence, res gestae may formerly have been, but is no longer, an exception to the rule against hearsay evidence based on the belief that, because certain statements are made naturally, spontaneously, and without deliberation during the course of an event, they leave little room for misunderstanding or misinterpretation upon hearing by someone else (e.g., by the witness, who will later repeat the statement to the court), and thus the courts believe that such statements carry a high degree of credibility. Statements that could be admitted into evidence as res gestae fall into three headings:

Words or phrases that either form part of, or explain, a physical act;
Exclamations that are so spontaneous as to belie concoction; and
Statements that are evidence of someone's state of mind.
The present sense impression, excited utterance, and then-existing mental, emotional, or physical condition hearsay exceptions, respective to the above headings, now cover many situations under the Federal Rules of Evidence that would formerly have been considered res gestae.
In some jurisdictions, the res gestae exception has also been used to admit police sketches."

Loverdos. In 1918 the bank was transformed from a limited partnership into a joint-stoick company called ""Bank of Kalamata.
After the death of Ioannis F. Kostopoulos, the reins of the bank were taken over initially by Spyros Kostopoulos and then by Dimitrios Kostopoulos, who in 1923 merged the banking division of the commercial house ""Ioannis F. Kostopoulos"" with the Bank of Kalamon, creating the ""Bank of Hellenic Commercial Credit"" based in Athens. On 2 November 1925 the bank was listed on the Athens Stock Exchange and in 1932 the bank moved to a privately owned building on
Stadiou and Pezmazoglou streets.
The economic crisis of 1929 forced the ""Bank of Hellenic Commercial Credit"" to reduce its network of branches and to seek financing from the National Bank of Greece, which now appointed a representative to its board of directors.

Henderson Land Dev;Diversified financials;"Reptiles, as commonly defined, are a group of tetrapods with an ectothermic ('cold-blooded') metabolism and amniotic development. Living traditional reptiles comprise four orders: Testudines (turtles), Crocodilia (crocodilians), Squamata (lizards and snakes), and Rhynchocephalia (the tuatara). As of May 2023, about 12,000 living species of reptiles are listed in the Reptile Database. The study of the traditional reptile orders, customarily in combination with the study of modern amphibians, is called herpetology.
Reptiles have been subject to several conflicting taxonomic definitions. In Linnaean taxonomy, reptiles are gathered together under the class Reptilia ( rep-TIL-ee-…ô), which corresponds to common usage. Modern cladistic taxonomy regards that group as paraphyletic, since genetic and paleontological evidence has determined that birds (class Aves), as members of Dinosauria, are more closely related to living crocodilians than to other reptiles, and are thus nested among reptiles from an evolutionary perspective. Many cladistic systems therefore redefine Reptilia as a clade (monophyletic group) including birds, though the precise definition of this clade varies between authors. Others prioritize the clade Sauropsida, which typically refers to all amniotes more closely related to modern reptiles than to mammals.
The earliest known proto-reptiles originated from the Carboniferous period, having evolved from advanced reptiliomorph tetrapods which became increasingly adapted to life on dry land."

It continues to be run by the 3rd and 4th generations of the Li family.
It was incorporated as a publicly listed bank in Hong Kong on 14 November 1918, and officially opened for business on 4 January 1919, by a group of local Hong Kong Chinese businessmen who ""not only understood modern banking, but the needs of modern Chinese business.""

=== Origins, and until 2008 ===
BEA was co-founded in Hong Kong on 14 November 1918 and officially opened for business on 4 January 1919. The idea of a local Hong Kong bank to blend East and West, essentially by embracing the style of a Chinese, family-run bank but also adopting modern accounting and banking methods, came from Kan Tong-po (Á∞°Êù±Êµ¶). Kan had the necessary banking background but needed the financial support of the Li brothers (Li Koon-chun and Li Tse-fong) and the sociopolitical support of Sir Shouson Chow, who would become co-founders, along with several other prominent local Hong Kong Chinese businessmen, including Fung Ping Shan (È¶ÆÂπ≥Â±±).
While Kan later sold his stake in the bank in the run-up to Hong Kong's handover, the Li family's influence in the bank continues to run deep today, with Sir David Li (3rd generation) being chairman, and his sons Adrian Li and Brian Li (4th generation) being co-CEOs.
BEA expanded rapidly internationally after opening."

Public Bank;Banking;"A public bank is a bank, a financial institution, in which a state, municipality, or public actors are the owners. It is an enterprise under government control. Prominent among current public banking models are the Bank of North Dakota, the Sparkassen-Finanzgruppe in Germany, and many nations' postal bank systems.
Public or 'state-owned' banks proliferated globally in the late 19th and early 20th centuries as vital agents of industrialisation in capitalist and socialist countries alike; as late as 2012, state banks still owned and controlled up to 25 per cent of total global banking assets.
Proponents of public banking argue that policymakers can create public-sector banks to reduce the costs of government services and infrastructure; protect and aid local banks; offer banking services to people and entities underserved by private-sector banking; and promote particular kinds of economic development reflecting polities' shared notions of social good. The 2015 Addis Ababa Financing for Development Action Agenda noted that public banks should have an important role in achieving the new Sustainable Development Goals. Increasingly, major international financial institutions are recognising the positive and catalytic role public banks can serve in the coming low carbon climate resilient transition. Further, international NGOs and critical scholars argue that public banks can play a significant role in financing a just and equitable energy transition.


== Definitions of public banking ==
According to the Public Banking Institute, ""[a] Public Bank is a chartered depository bank in which public funds are deposited. A Public Bank is owned by a government unit‚Äîa state, county, city, or tribe‚Äîand mandated to serve a public mission that reflects the values and needs of the public that it represents."" According to Ellen Brown, public ownership of a bank is distinct from state-socialism in that the latter is government ownership of the means of production, whereas public banking involves government oversight of the credit and debit system that facilitates economic exchange, including that of free markets."

Scana;Utilities;"A scandal can be broadly defined as the strong social reactions of outrage, anger, or surprise, when accusations or rumours circulate or appear for some reason, regarding a person or persons who are perceived to have transgressed in some way a social norm. These reactions are usually noisy and may be conflicting, and they often have negative effects on the status and credibility of the persons or organizations involved.
Society is scandalized when it becomes aware of breaches of moral norms or legal requirements, often when these have remained undiscovered or been concealed for some time. Such breaches have typically erupted from greed, lust, or the abuse of power. Scandals may be regarded as political, sexual, moral, literary, or artistic, but often spread from one realm into another. The basis of a scandal may be factual or false, or a combination of both. In contemporary times, exposure of a scandalous situation is often made by mass media. 
Contemporary media has the capacity to spread knowledge of a scandal further than in previous centuries and public interest has encouraged many cases of confected scandals relating to well-known people as well as genuine scandals relating to politics and business. Some scandals are revealed by whistleblowers who discover wrongdoing within organizations or groups, such as Deep Throat (William Mark Felt) during the Watergate scandal in the 1970s in the United States. Whistleblowers may be protected by laws which are used to obtain information of misdeeds and acts detrimental to their establishments."

Yahoo;Software & services;"Yahoo ( , styled yahoo! in its logo) is an American web portal that provides the search engine Yahoo Search and related services including My Yahoo, Yahoo Mail, Yahoo News, Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports, y!entertainment, and its advertising platform, Yahoo Native. It is operated by the namesake company Yahoo! Inc., which is 90% owned by Apollo Global Management and 10% by Verizon.
Yahoo was established by Jerry Yang and David Filo in January 1994 and was one of the pioneers of the early Internet era in the 1990s. However, its use declined in the 2010s as some of its services were discontinued, and it lost market share to Facebook and Google.


== Etymology ==
The word ""yahoo"" is a backronym for ""Yet Another Hierarchically Organized Oracle"" or ""Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle"". The term ""hierarchical"" described how the Yahoo database was arranged in layers of subcategories. The term ""oracle"" was intended to mean ""source of truth and wisdom"", and the term ""officious"", rather than being related to the word's normal meaning, described the many office workers who would use the Yahoo database while surfing from work. However, founders Filo and Yang insist they mainly selected the name because they liked the slang definition of a ""yahoo"" (used by college students in David Filo's native Louisiana in the late 1980s and early 1990s to refer to an unsophisticated, rural Southerner): ""rude, unsophisticated, uncouth."" This meaning derives from the Yahoo race of fictional beings from Gulliver's Travels."

== History ==


=== SSIH ===
SSIH (Soci√©t√© Suisse pour l'Industrie Horlog√®re), originated in 1930 with the merger of the Omega and Tissot companies. Swiss watch quality was high, but new technology, such as the Hamilton Electric watch introduced in 1957 and the Bulova Accutron tuning fork watch in 1961, presaged increasing technological competition.
In the late 1970s, SSIH became insolvent due in part to a recession and in part to heavy competition from inexpensive Asian-made quartz crystal watches. These difficulties occurred even though it had become Switzerland's largest, and the world's third largest, producer of watches. Its creditor banks assumed control in 1981.

== History ==
Toray Industries had been originally established as Toyo Rayon in 1926 by Mitsui Bussan, one of the two largest Japanese trading companies (sogo shosha) of the time (the other being Mitsubishi Shoji). The fact that Mitsui did not allow the company to be named as a Mitsui company indicates their skepticism of the risk on the business. Risk arose from the fact that, when it was established, the company did not have the right technology to produce Rayon. It had approached Courtaulds and then Du Pont to buy the technology but, because the price was too high, it decided to buy equipment from a German engineering company and hire about twenty foreign engineers to start the operation.
When Nylon was invented in 1935 by Wallace Carothers of DuPont, Toray immediately got hold of a sample product through the New York City branch of Mitsui Bussan, and started research by dissolving this sample in sulfuric acid."

Mediobanca;Diversified financials;"Mediobanca S.p.A. is an Italian investment bank founded in 1946 at the initiative of Raffaele Mattioli (at that time CEO of Banca Commerciale Italiana) and Enrico Cuccia to facilitate the post-World War II reconstruction of Italian industry. Cuccia led Mediobanca from 1946 to 1982. Today, it is an international banking group with offices in Milan, Frankfurt, London, Madrid, Luxembourg, New York and Paris.
As of today, Mediobanca Group is a diversified banking group consisting of four business divisions: Wealth Management, Corporate & Investment Banking, Consumer Finance and Insurance. The Wealth Management area, whose launch in 2016 reshaped the group's strategy, recorded the highest growth rates in the second half of 2023 and is expected to become by 2026 the first business in terms of fee income and the second in terms of revenues. 
The company is listed in the FTSE MIB index of the Borsa Italiana and a member of the Standard Ethics Italian Banks Index.
Mediobanca has been designated as a Significant Institution since the entry into force of European Banking Supervision in late 2014, and as a consequence is directly supervised by the European Central Bank.


== History ==
Mediobanca was set up to provide medium-term financing for manufacturers and establish a direct relationship between the banking sector and the investment needs of the reorganization of industry after the devastation caused by World War II. The Banking Act of 1936 established a clear separation between short term and medium-to-long term financing and the major banks had opted for specializing in short-term loans and there was the institution that would deal with financing for the flotation of companies that wished to obtain a stock market listing. In addition to granting consolidated loans against certificates of deposit and savings books, Mediobanca developed its activity of placement of bonds and shares issued by Italian companies. The professionalism developed by the bank under the, some would say brilliant, guidance of Enrico Cuccia enabled it to quickly acquire a position of leadership in the field of investment banking in Italy."

== History ==


=== 1910‚Äì1974 ===
1910 ‚Äì ""The Black & Decker Manufacturing Company"" was founded by S. Duncan Black (1883‚Äì1951) and Alonzo G. Decker (1884‚Äì1956) as a small machine shop in Baltimore in September. Decker, who had only a seventh grade education, had met Black in 1906, when they were both 23-year-old workers at the Rowland Telegraph Company. With only $1,200 between them, one of their first jobs was designing machinery for making milk bottle caps and candy dipping.
1912 ‚Äì The Black and Decker ""Hexagon"" logo symbol was introduced, symbolizing the head of a hexagonal bolt found in machine shops. It was used in one form or another from 1912 to 2014.
1917 ‚Äì Black & Decker invented and patented the hand-held electric drill with a pistol grip and trigger switch.
‚Äì‚Äì For many decades the director of design was Glenn Calvin Wilhide, a friend of Walter Gropius and other industrial designers of the day."
Quanta Computer;Technology hardware & equipment;"A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena. On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing takes advantage of this behavior using specialized hardware. Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer. Theoretically a large-scale quantum computer could break some widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.
The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or ""quantum bit""), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing. However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, a state that is in an abstract sense ""between"" the two basis states. When measuring a qubit, the result is a probabilistic output of a classical bit. If a quantum computer manipulates the qubit in a particular way, wave interference effects can amplify the desired measurement results. The design of quantum algorithms involves creating procedures that allow a quantum computer to perform calculations efficiently and quickly.
Quantum computers are not yet practical for real-world applications."

=== Founding of Inco ===
The company was founded following the discovery by blacksmith Tom Flanagan in Copper Cliff, Ontario of chalcopyrite deposits, while the Canadian Pacific Railway was being built in 1883; the township of Sudbury soon followed in 1884 when JL Morris, provincial land surveyor, laid it out. Initially, ore was shipped for smelting to a plant in Constable Hook, New Jersey, owned by the Orford Copper Company. Processing revealed in 1884 that the ore was also rich in nickel and exploration tests revealed an enormous potential. In 1893 Robert M. Thompson patented the Orford ""Tops and Bottoms"" process; this was the first commercially viable method of separating (Fe,Ni)9S8 Pentlandite-borne Nickel from the CuFeS2 Chalcopyrite-borne Copper.
The Spanish-American War focused the eyes of the world on nickel steel, because in the Battle of Manila Bay and the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, the American losses were negligible while the Spanish losses were catastrophic."

== History ==


=== Early years ===
In 1945, U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Juan Trippe, President of Pan Am, discussed their concern for Latin America's need for development funds at a White House breakfast. The two men thought that one way to attract businessmen and tourists would be to offer luxury hotels in key cities. Trippe contacted Statler Hotels' chief executive H.B. Callis, and his company undertook a feasibility study, but the company decided the program would be too expensive. Trippe contacted multiple other US hotel chains, but none showed interest. Roosevelt requested that Pan Am take the lead in developing 5000 hotel rooms in Latin America, with a projected cost of $50,000,000. Pan Am's profit that year was only $3 million, so a $25,000,000 line of credit was arranged for Pan Am with the Export‚ÄìImport Bank of the United States. Trippe agreed to form a subsidiary company to foster the implementation of the idea."
Corning;Technology hardware & equipment;"Coring happens when a heated alloy, such as a Cu-Ni system, cools in non-equilibrium conditions. The center of each grain, which is the first part to freeze, is rich in the high-melting element (e.g., nickel for this Cu‚ÄìNi system), whereas the concentration of the low-melting element increases with position from this region to the grain boundary. This is termed a 'cored structure', which gives rise to less than the optimal properties. The distribution of the two elements within the grains is nonuniform, a phenomenon termed 'segregation'; that is, concentration gradients are established across the grains. 
As a casting having a cored structure is reheated, grain boundary regions will melt first in as much as they are richer in the low-melting component. This produces a sudden loss in mechanical integrity due to the thin liquid film that separates the grains. Furthermore, this melting may begin at a temperature below the equilibrium solidus temperature of the alloy. Coring may be eliminated by a homogenization heat treatment carried out at a temperature below the solidus point for the particular alloy composition. During this process, atomic diffusion occurs, which produces compositionally homogeneous grains.
Coring is predominantly observed in alloys having a marked difference between liquidus and solidus temperatures."

=== Basic operation ===

Microsoft Excel has the basic features of all spreadsheets, using a grid of cells arranged in numbered rows and letter-named columns to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering, and financial needs. In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors for different perspectives (using pivot tables and the scenario manager). A PivotTable is a tool for data analysis. It does this by simplifying large data sets via PivotTable fields. It has a programming aspect, Visual Basic for Applications, allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics, and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet. It also has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called application, or decision support system (DSS), via a custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer, or in general, as a design tool that asks the user questions and provides answers and reports."

Corus Group;Materials;"Tata Steel Europe Ltd. (formerly Corus Group plc) was a steelmaking company headquartered in London, England, with its main operations in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The company was created in 2007, when Tata Group took over the British-Dutch Corus Group. 
In 2021, the company was split into a British and a Dutch branch: Tata Steel Netherlands (TSN) and Tata Steel UK, both of which fell directly under the Indian parent company Tata Steel.
Corus Group was formed through the merger of the Koninklijke Hoogovens and British Steel plc in 1999 and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. It was acquired by Tata of India in 2007, and renamed Tata Steel Europe in September 2010.
At formation Corus operated steelmaking plants (blast furnaces) in  Port Talbot and Llanwern, Wales; Scunthorpe and Teesside, England; and IJmuiden, Netherlands, with additional steelmaking facilities in Rotherham, England (electric arc furnace), as well as downstream steel production of both long and flat steel.
Profitability at the business was affected by the Great Recession: the Teesside plant was mothballed and sold in 2009/2010; the long products division including the steelworks at Scunthorpe was sold for a nominal sum to Greybull Capital in April 2016.

Monsanto;Chemicals;"The Monsanto Company () was an American agrochemical and agricultural biotechnology corporation founded in 1901 and headquartered in Creve Coeur, Missouri. Monsanto's best-known product is Roundup, a glyphosate-based herbicide, developed in the 1970s. Later, the company became a major producer of genetically engineered crops. In 2018, the company ranked 199th on the Fortune 500 of the largest United States corporations by revenue.
Monsanto was one of four groups to introduce genes into plants in 1983, and was among the first to conduct field trials of genetically modified crops in 1987. It was one of the top-ten U.S. chemical companies until it divested most of its chemical businesses between 1997 and 2002, through a process of mergers and spin-offs that focused the company on biotechnology. 
Monsanto was one of the first companies to apply the biotechnology industry business model to agriculture, using techniques developed by biotech drug companies.:‚Ää2‚Äì6‚Ää In this business model, companies recoup R&D expenses by exploiting biological patents.
Monsanto's roles in agricultural changes, biotechnology products, lobbying of government agencies, and roots as a chemical company have resulted in controversies. The company once manufactured controversial products such as the insecticide DDT, PCBs, Agent Orange, and recombinant bovine growth hormone.
In September 2016, German chemical company Bayer announced its intent to acquire Monsanto for US$66 billion in an all-cash deal."
RadioShack;Retailing;"RadioShack (formerly written as Radio Shack) is an American electronics retailer that was established in 1921 as an amateur radio mail-order business. Its parent company was purchased by Tandy Corporation in 1962, which shifted its focus from mail-order radio equipment to hobbyist electronics sold at retail. Tandy ended the mail-order business, opened small stores staffed by people who knew electronics, greatly reduced the number of items carried, and replaced name-brand products with private-label items from lower-cost manufacturers. These moves were successful and the brand grew.
In the late 1970s, the company branched into personal computers, and in the 1990s, it began to focus on wireless phones and de-emphasize the hobbyist market. RadioShack reached its peak in 1999, when Tandy operated over 8,000 stores in the United States, Mexico, and Canada, and under the Tandy name in The Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, the United Kingdom, and Australia. However, its sales strategy increasingly competed with big-box stores and dedicated wireless phone retailers, and it fell into decline.
In February 2015, after years of management crises, poor worker relations, diminished revenue, and 11 consecutive quarterly losses, RadioShack was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange and subsequently filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. In May 2015, the company's assets were purchased by General Wireless, a subsidiary of Standard General, for US$26.2 million. In March 2017, General Wireless and subsidiaries also filed for bankruptcy and RadioShack announced plans to shift its business primarily online."

There are various generalizations, depending on the field.


== History ==

The logistic function was introduced in a series of three papers by Pierre Fran√ßois Verhulst between 1838 and 1847, who devised it as a model of population growth by adjusting the exponential growth model, under the guidance of Adolphe Quetelet. Verhulst first devised the function in the mid 1830s, publishing a brief note in 1838, then presented an expanded analysis and named the function in 1844 (published 1845); the third paper adjusted the correction term in his model of Belgian population growth.
The initial stage of growth is approximately exponential (geometric); then, as saturation begins, the growth slows to linear (arithmetic), and at maturity, growth approaches the limit with an exponentially decaying gap, like the initial stage in reverse.
Verhulst did not explain the choice of the term ""logistic"" (French: logistique), but it is presumably in contrast to the logarithmic curve, and by analogy with arithmetic and geometric. His growth model is preceded by a discussion of arithmetic growth and geometric growth (whose curve he calls a logarithmic curve, instead of the modern term exponential curve), and thus ""logistic growth"" is presumably named by analogy, logistic being from Ancient Greek: ŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπœÉœÑŒπŒ∫œåœÇ, romanized: logistik√≥s, a traditional division of Greek mathematics."

The lemon is a hybrid of the citron and the bitter orange. Its origins are uncertain, but some evidence suggests lemons originated during the 1st millennium BC in what is now northeastern India.
The yellow fruit of the lemon tree is used throughout the world, primarily for its juice. The pulp and rind are used in cooking and baking. The juice of the lemon is about 5‚Äì6% citric acid, giving it a sour taste. This makes it a key ingredient in drinks and foods such as lemonade and lemon meringue pie.
In 2022, world production was 22 million tonnes, led by India with 18% of the total.

Rallye;Retailing;"Rallying is a wide-ranging form of motorsport with various competitive motoring elements such as speed tests (sometimes called ""rally racing"" in United States), navigation tests, or the ability to reach waypoints or a destination at a prescribed time or average speed. Rallies may be short in the form of trials at a single venue, or several thousand miles long in an extreme endurance rally.
Depending on the format, rallies may be organised on private or public roads, open or closed to traffic, or off-road in the form of cross country or rally-raid. Competitors can use production vehicles which must be road-legal if being used on open roads or specially built competition vehicles suited to crossing specific terrain.
In most cases rallying distinguishes itself from other forms of motorsport by not running directly against other competitors over laps of a circuit, but instead in a point-to-point format in which participants leave at regular intervals from one or more start points.


== Rally types ==
Rallies generally fall under two categories, road rallies and cross-country (off-road). Different types of rally are described however a rally may be a mix of types.


=== Road rallies ===
Road rallies are the original form held on public highways open to traffic. In its annually published International Sporting Code, the F√©d√©ration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) includes the following definition of rally:Rally: Road Competition with an imposed average speed run entirely or partly on roads open to normal traffic.

== History ==


=== 1956‚Äì2007 ===
KB Home was founded in Detroit in 1956 by Donald Bruce Kaufman and Eli Broad. Their first venture together was the construction of two model homes in the Northeast Detroit suburbs, where a new generation of first-time home buyers were flocking. By streamlining the construction process and eliminating basements, offering a carport instead, they could price the houses so the monthly mortgage would be less than the rent for a two-bedroom apartment. Kaufman and Broad christened this model the ""Award Winner"" and priced it at $13,700.  After one weekend, seventeen were sold and within two years, Kaufman and Broad had built 600 homes in the Detroit suburbs."

Amersham;Health care equipment & services;"Amersham ( AM-…ôr-sh…ôm) is a market town and civil parish in Buckinghamshire, England, in the Chiltern Hills, 27 miles (43 km) northwest of central London, 15 miles (24 km) south-east of Aylesbury and 9 miles (14 km) north-east of High Wycombe. Amersham is part of the London commuter belt.
There are two distinct areas:

Old Amersham, set in the valley of the River Misbourne, containing the 13th-century parish church of St. Mary's and several old pubs and coaching inns
Amersham-on-the-Hill, which grew in the early 20th century around Amersham station, which was served by the Metropolitan Railway (now the Metropolitan line) and the Great Central Railway.


== Geography ==

Old Amersham occupies the valley floor of the River Misbourne. This is a chalk stream which dries up periodically. The river occupies a valley much larger than it is possible for a river the size of the present River Misbourne to cut, which makes it a misfit stream. The valley floor is at around 100 m (330 ft) OD, and the valley top is at around 165 m (541 ft) OD. It is likely that the valley was formed under conditions akin to those required to form a dry valley. Amersham-on-the-Hill is built on the north side of the Misbourne valley on a small plateau that forms the watershed between the Misbourne and the neighbouring River Chess.


== History ==

The name ""Amersham"" is derived from the Old English for 'Ealhmund's village (hƒÅm)'."

Sappi;Materials;"Sap is a fluid transported in the xylem cells (vessel elements or tracheids) or phloem sieve tube elements of a plant.  These cells transport water and nutrients throughout the plant.
Sap is distinct from latex, resin, or cell sap; it is a separate substance, separately produced, and with different components and functions.
Insect honeydew is called sap, particularly when it falls from trees, but is only the remains of eaten sap and other plant parts.


== Types of sap ==
Saps may be broadly divided into two types:  xylem sap and phloem sap.


=== Xylem sap ===
Xylem sap (pronounced ) consists primarily of a watery solution of hormones, mineral elements and other nutrients. Transport of sap in xylem is characterized by movement from the roots toward the leaves.
Over the past century, there has been some controversy regarding the mechanism of xylem sap transport; today, most plant scientists agree that the cohesion-tension theory best explains this process, but multiforce theories that hypothesize several alternative mechanisms have been suggested, including longitudinal cellular and xylem osmotic pressure gradients, axial potential gradients in the vessels, and gel- and gas-bubble-supported interfacial gradients.
Xylem sap transport can be disrupted by cavitation‚Äîan ""abrupt phase change [of water] from liquid to vapor""‚Äîresulting in air-filled xylem conduits. In addition to being a fundamental physical limit on tree height, two environmental stresses can disrupt xylem transport by cavitation: increasingly negative xylem pressures associated with water stress, and freeze-thaw cycles in temperate climates."

=== Beginnings ===

Paul Reuter noticed that, with the electric telegraph, news no longer required days or weeks to travel long distances. In the 1850s, the 34-year-old Reuter was based in Aachen ‚Äì then in the Kingdom of Prussia, now in Germany ‚Äì close to the borders with the Netherlands and Belgium. He began using the newly opened Berlin‚ÄìAachen telegraph line to send news to Berlin. However, the telegraph did not extend the 76 miles (122 km) to Brussels, Belgium's capital city and financial center. Reuter saw an opportunity to speed up news service between Brussels and Berlin by using homing pigeons to bridge that gap.
In 1851, Reuter moved to London."

== Board of directors ==


== Company history ==

In 1883 in Carthage, Missouri, J.P. Leggett developed a new type of bedspring consisting of single cone spring wire coils, formed and interlaced, then mounted on a wood slat base. The bedspring could then be used as a base for the then-popular cotton, feather, or horsehair mattresses.  Needing expertise in manufacturing and production, he recruited his soon-to-be brother-in-law, C.B. Platt, whose father owned and operated Platt Plow Works, into the partnership. Together, they produced the components of their Leggett & Platt bedspring, which was patented in 1885.

The Carthage market for their new product was very limited. To expand the market to a wider region,  Platt and George Leggett, brother of J. P. Leggett, would load a horse-drawn wagon with bedsprings and travel to surrounding communities. Often, to conserve space, they would load the springs and slats separately into the wagon and assemble them in a store or on an adjacent sidewalk. The partnership prospered, and the business was incorporated in 1901."

Egypt continued to be known officially as the United Arab Republic until it was formally dissolved by Anwar Sadat in September 1971.

== History ==


=== Origins ===

The United Arab Republic was established on 1 February 1958 as the first step towards a larger pan-Arab state, originally being proposed to Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser by a group of political and military leaders in Syria.
Pan-Arab sentiment traditionally was very strong in Syria, and Nasser was a popular heroic figure throughout the Arab world following the 1956 Tripartite Aggression. There was thus considerable popular support in Syria for union with Nasser's Egypt. The Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party was the leading advocate of such a union."

Gerdau was founded as the Pontas de Paris nail manufacturing business by Jo√£o Gerdau, a German migrant who left the port of Hamburg for Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil, in 1869 in search of new business opportunities.
He passed the business to his son, Hugo Gerdau, who, in 1946, passed it to his son-in-law Curt Johannpeter. After the end of World War II, the nail factory struggled to find raw material. To secure raw materials, the company acquired a steel mill in 1948. By the 1960s, the mill was at capacity and in 1967, the company acquired a minimill in S√£o Paulo. In 1969, the company was renamed Metal√∫rgica Gerdau S.A. In 1970, the company became a public company via listings on the Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange and S√£o Paulo Stock Exchange."

Iberia;Transportation;"The Iberian Peninsula (IPA:  eye-BEER-ee-…ôn), also known as Iberia, is a peninsula in south-western Europe. Mostly separated from the rest of the European landmass by the Pyrenees, it includes the territories of peninsular Spain and Continental Portugal, comprising most of the region, as well as the tiny adjuncts of Andorra, Gibraltar, and, pursuant to the traditional definition of the Pyrenees as the peninsula's northeastern boundary, a small part of France. With an area of approximately 583,254 square kilometres (225,196 sq mi), and a population of roughly 55 million, it is the second-largest European peninsula by area, after the Scandinavian Peninsula.


== Etymology ==

The Iberian Peninsula has always been associated with the River Ebro (Ibƒìros in ancient Greek and Ibƒìrus or Hibƒìrus in Latin). The association was so well known it was hardly necessary to state; for example, Ibƒìria was the country ""this side of the Ibƒìrus"" in Strabo. Pliny goes so far as to assert that the Greeks had called ""the whole of the peninsula"" Hiberia because of the Hiberus River. The river appears in the Ebro Treaty of 226 BCE between Rome and Carthage, setting the limit of Carthaginian interest at the Ebro. The fullest description of the treaty, stated in Appian, uses Ibƒìrus. With reference to this border, Polybius states that the ""native name"" is Ibƒìr, apparently the original word, stripped of its Greek or Latin -os or -us termination.
The early range of these natives, which geographers and historians place from the present southern Spain to the present southern France along the Mediterranean coast, is marked by instances of a readable script expressing a yet unknown language, dubbed ""Iberian""."

CDW;Retailing;"Edward is an English male name. It is derived from the Anglo-Saxon name ƒíadweard, composed of the elements ƒìad ""wealth, fortunate; prosperous"" and weard ""guardian, protector‚Äù.


== History ==
The name Edward was very popular in Anglo-Saxon England, but the rule of the Norman and Plantagenet dynasties had effectively ended its use amongst the upper classes. The popularity of the name was revived when Henry III named his firstborn son, the future Edward I, as part of his efforts to promote a cult around Edward the Confessor, for whom Henry had a deep admiration.


== Variant forms ==

The name has been adopted in the Iberian peninsula since the 15th century, due to Edward, King of Portugal, whose mother was English. The Spanish/Portuguese forms of the name are Eduardo and Duarte. Other variant forms include French √âdouard, Italian Edoardo and Odoardo, German, Dutch, Czech and Romanian Eduard and Scandinavian Edvard.
Short forms include   Ed, Eddy, Eddie,  Ted, Teddy and Ned.

ProLogis;Diversified financials;"Prolog is a logic programming language that has its origins in artificial intelligence, automated theorem proving and computational linguistics.
Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program is a set of facts and rules, which define relations.  A computation is initiated by running a query over the program.
Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages and remains the most popular such language today, with several free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for theorem proving, expert systems, term rewriting, type systems, and automated planning, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing.
Prolog is a Turing-complete, general-purpose programming language, which is well-suited for intelligent knowledge-processing applications.


== History ==

The name Prolog was chosen by Philippe Roussel, at the suggestion of his wife, as an abbreviation for Programmation en logique (French for Programming in logic). It was created around 1972 by Alain Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel, from the Artificial Intelligence Group of the Faculty of Sciences of Luminy of Aix-Marseille II University of France. It was based on Robert Kowalski's procedural interpretation of Horn clauses, and it was motivated in part by the desire to reconcile the use of logic as a declarative knowledge representation language with the procedural representation of knowledge that was popular in North America in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Robert Kowalski, the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer and Phillipe Roussel."

With this aim, OPAP was established in 1958 as a private legal entity under the umbrella of the General Secretariat for Sport. At the same time of its establishment, a Royal Decree institutionalized the first game OPAP introduced named PRO-PO (the Greek Acronym for Football Prognostics) which was organised along the lines of Italy's Toto Calcio.

Samsung South;Trading companies;"Samson (; Hebrew: ◊©÷¥◊Å◊û÷∞◊©◊Å◊ï÷π◊ü ≈†im≈°≈çn ""man of the sun"") was the last of the judges of the ancient Israelites mentioned in the Book of Judges (chapters 13 to 16) and one of the last leaders who ""judged"" the tribes of Israel before the institution of the monarchy. He is sometimes considered as an Israelite version of the popular Near Eastern folk hero also embodied by the Sumerian Gilgamesh and Enkidu, as well as the Greek Heracles. Samson was given superhuman powers by God in the form of extreme strength.
The biblical account states that Samson was a Nazirite and that he was given immense strength to aid him against his enemies and allow him to perform superhuman feats, including slaying a lion with his bare hands and massacring a Philistine army with a donkey's jawbone. The cutting of Samson's long hair would violate his Nazirite vow and nullify his ability.
Samson is betrayed by his lover Delilah, who, sent by Philistine officials to entice him, orders a servant to cut his hair while he is sleeping and turns him over to the Philistines, who gouge out his eyes and force him to mill grain at Gaza City. While there, his hair begins to grow again. When the Philistines take Samson into their temple of Dagon, Samson asks to rest against one of the support pillars. After being granted permission, he prays to God and miraculously recovers his strength, allowing him to bring down the columns ‚Äì collapsing the temple and killing both himself and the Philistines. In some Jewish traditions, Samson is believed to have been buried in Zorah in Israel overlooking the Sorek valley (also considered his birthplace)."

Chiron;Drugs & biotechnology;"In Greek mythology, Charon or Kharon ( KAIR-on, -‚Å†…ôn; Ancient Greek: ŒßŒ¨œÅœâŒΩ Ancient Greek pronunciation: [k ∞√°.r…îÀên]) is a psychopomp, the ferryman of the Greek underworld. He carries the souls of those who have been given funeral rites across the rivers Acheron and Styx, which separate the worlds of the living and the dead. Archaeology confirms that, in some burials, low-value coins known generically as Charon's obols were placed in, on, or near the mouth of the deceased, or next to the cremation urn containing their ashes. This has been taken to confirm that at least some aspects of Charon's mytheme are reflected in some Greek and Roman funeral practices, or else the coins function as a viaticum for the soul's journey. In Virgil's epic poem, Aeneid, the dead who could not pay the fee, and those who had received no funeral rites, had to wander the near shores of the Styx for one hundred years before they were allowed to cross the river. Charon also ferried the living mortals Heracles and Aeneas to the underworld and back again.


== Name origins ==
The name Charon is most often explained as a proper noun from œáŒ¨œÅœâŒΩ (charon), a poetic form of œáŒ±œÅœâœÄœåœÇ (charop√≥s) 'of keen gaze', referring either to fierce, flashing, or feverish eyes, or to eyes of a bluish-grey color. The word may be a euphemism for death. Flashing eyes may indicate the anger or irascibility of Charon as he is often characterized in literature, but the etymology is not certain. The ancient historian Diodorus Siculus thought that the ferryman and his name had been imported from Egypt."

Seibu Railway;Transportation;"Seibu Railway Company, Ltd. (Ë•øÊ≠¶ÈâÑÈÅìÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ, Seibu Tetsud≈ç Kabushiki-gaisha) is a conglomerate based in Tokorozawa, Saitama, Japan, with principal business areas in railways, tourism, and real estate. Seibu Railway's operations are concentrated in northwest Tokyo and Saitama Prefecture; the name ""Seibu"" is an abbreviation of ""west Musashi"", referring to the historic name for this area. It and its holding company hold shares of numerous bus, hotel and tourism operations nationwide.


== History ==
""Seibu Railway"" was originally the name of a tram service between Shinjuku and Ogikubo, which was transferred to the Tokyo metropolitan government in 1951 and eventually closed in 1962. The Seibu Railway was acquired in 1921 by the Kawagoe Railway, which had operated a train service between Kokubunji and Kawagoe since 1894; the merged company kept the ""Seibu"" name and expanded its main line to Takadanobaba, forming what is now known as the Seibu Shinjuku Line.
The current Seibu Railway is a product of a 1945 merger between the former Seibu Railway and the Musashino Railway, which was founded in 1912 to operate what is now known as the Seibu Ikebukuro Line. The merger was largely orchestrated by Yasujir≈ç Tsutsumi, a real estate developer who opened the Tamako Railway (now the Seibu Tamako Line) in 1928, became a major shareholder in the Musashino Railway and merged the two in 1940.
In 1944, the Tokyo metropolitan government, under the administration of Shigeo ≈ådachi, hired the Seibu Railway and the Musashino Railway to provide a coordinated service to transport night soil from central Tokyo to outlying disposal areas. At the time, night soil was generally transported by truck to Tokyo Bay and disposed of by dumping there, but the progress of World War II led to gasoline and personnel shortages which made this system unsustainable."

Royal Numico;Food drink & tobacco;"Nutricia is a Danone brand that specialises in therapeutic food and infant formula, including medical nutrition for babies with specific needs.
The former company, N.V. Nutricia., was established in The Netherlands by brothers Jan and Martinus van der Hagen, who started the production of infant milk formula in 1896 and diabetic milk products and iodine enriched milks in 1905. 


== History ==

In 1885, the German professor Alexander Backhaus developed a technique in his laboratory that removed the more slowly digested casein protein from cow‚Äôs milk, leaving behind only the faster dissolving and more easily digestible whey proteins. Backhaus‚Äô new formulation was better tolerated and closer in composition to human milk. Since the composition of cow‚Äôs milk was not appropriate for feeding infants and could, at that time, be a source of disease contributing to high infant mortality across Europe.
Backhaus filed a patent and presented his invention at a medical conference in Berlin in 1896 where Johannes van der Hagen, a medical doctor, and Dutch Public Health Inspector, was in the audience. Johannes introduced Backhaus to his brother, Martinus van der Hagen, who owned a factory in The Netherlands producing margarine and dairy products. Backhaus granted them rights to manufacture his infant milk formula.

In 1901, the ""Nutricia"" name was adopted and became known as ‚ÄúThe Wet Nurse of The Netherlands.‚Äù Five years later, Nutricia began to introduce new special diet products such as low-sugar milk for diabetic patients and iodine-rich milk for those suffering from goitre, marking the beginnings of 'medical nutrition' as a category.
In 1924, Nutricia moved its main (powder) production facilities (from van der Hagen's original factory) to the N.V. Cuijk's Dairy Factory."

In 2011, the property went into foreclosure and reverted to lenders. The shopping center was reopened under the name Westgate Entertainment District, operated by Vestar Capital Partners, which also manages other properties in the Phoenix area.


== Development ==
Glendale Arizona's Westgate Entertainment District is a 223-acre (0.90 km2), mixed-used development that was originally proposed to include 8,000,000 square feet (740,000 m2) of shopping, dining, entertainment, high-end condominiums, parks, and office space.  It is anchored by Desert Diamond Arena, former home of the Arizona Coyotes, and next to State Farm Stadium, home to the NFL's Arizona Cardinals, the Fiesta Bowl and host of Super Bowl XLII, Super Bowl XLIX and Super Bowl LVII.

Development of Westgate Entertainment District began with the construction of the Desert Diamond Arena, then referred to as the Glendale Arena.  Construction of the Arena was completed in late 2003 and it hosted its first NHL game on December 27 of that same year, while construction of the remainder of Westgate's Entertainment District began in October 2005, opening one year later.  The Coyotes played their final game in Glendale on April 29, 2022, and rallied from a 4-goal deficit to defeat the Nashville Predators 5 to 4.

Intuit;Software & services;"Inuit (singular: Inuk) are a group of culturally and historically similar Indigenous peoples traditionally inhabiting the Arctic and Subarctic regions of North America and Russia, including Greenland, Labrador, Quebec, Nunavut, the Northwest Territories, Yukon (traditionally), Alaska, and the Chukotsky District of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. Inuit languages are part of the Eskimo‚ÄìAleut languages, also known as Inuit-Yupik-Unangan, and also as Eskaleut. 
Canadian Inuit live throughout most of Northern Canada in the territory of Nunavut, Nunavik in the northern third of Quebec, the Nunatsiavut in Labrador, and in various parts of the Northwest Territories and Yukon (traditionally), particularly around the Arctic Ocean, in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region. These areas are known, primarily by Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami, as Inuit Nunangat. In Canada, sections 25 and 35 of the Constitution Act of 1982 classify Inuit as a distinctive group of Aboriginal Canadians who are not included under either the First Nations or the M√©tis.
Greenlandic Inuit, also known as Kalaallit, are descendants of Thule migrations from Canada by 1100 CE. Although Greenland withdrew from the European Communities in 1985, Inuit of Greenland are Danish citizens and, as such, remain citizens of the European Union. In the United States, the Alaskan I√±upiat are traditionally located in the Northwest Arctic Borough, on the Alaska North Slope, the Bering Strait and on Little Diomede Island. In Russia, few pockets of diaspora communities of Russian I√±upiat from Big Diomede Island, of which inhabitants were removed to Russian Mainland, remain in Bering Strait coast of Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, particularly in Uelen, Lavrentiya, and Lorino.
Many individuals who would have historically been referred to as Eskimo find that term offensive or forced upon them in a colonial way, Inuit is now a common autonym for a large sub-group of these people. The word Inuit (varying forms I√±upiat, Inuvialuit, Inughuit, etc.), however, is an ancient self-referential to a group of peoples which includes at most the I√±upiat of Bering Strait coast of Chukotka and northern Alaska, the four broad groups of Inuit in Canada, and the Greenlandic Inuit."

Nabors is notable for its connection to the Guggenheim family, whose members founded the company and ran it in its early years.


== Predecessor companies ==


=== Anglo-Lautaro ===
Nabors Industries traces its history to the early 20th century and the Guggenheim family's business interests in South America. In 1924, the Guggenheims used the profits from the sale of their Chuquicamata copper properties to purchase the Anglo-Chilean Nitrate and Railways Company Limited, a British business. They then formed a new Delaware corporation on 22 December 1924, the Anglo-Chilean Consolidated Nitrate Corporation Limited, which acquired all the assets of ACNRC. In 1929 they acquired another British nitrate business, the Lautaro Nitrate Company Limited, which had been founded in 1889. The family ran the companies separately until 1950, when they merged them into then Anglo-Lautaro Nitrate Corporation Limited. During the presidency of Salvador Allende, Chile nationalised its nitrate industry and the Guggenheims were forced to sell the assets of Anglo-Lautaro. In 1971 the government paid $7,885,590 for Anglo-Lautaro, which resulted in a $25,912,956 loss for the company."

Publishing & Broadcasting;Media;"Publishing and Broadcasting Limited (PBL) was one of Australia's largest corporations. With interests primarily in media and gambling, for the entirety of its existence it was largely controlled by the Packer family.


== History ==


=== Predecessors ===
PBL originated with Australian Consolidated Press (ACP), established by media magnate Frank Packer, who inherited the media interests of his father Robert Packer, who died in 1934. In 1936, Packer merged with E.G. Theodore's Sydney Newspapers and Associated Newspapers to form Australian Consolidated Press. Frank Packer was chairman of ACP from 1936 until his death in 1974, when control of the company passed to his younger son Kerry Packer.
ACP was granted a broadcasting license in Sydney when television began in Australia in the 1950s. Its television station, TCN-9 in Sydney was the first station in Australia to go to air, launched 1956, by an announcement from Bruce Gyngell ""Good evening, and welcome to television"".
In 1960, it purchased GTV-9 Melbourne to form the first television network in Australia, the National Television Network, later to become the National Nine Network.
In 1987, Kerry Packer sold the Nine Network to Alan Bond for $1 billion, who then expanded the network to include QTQ-9 Brisbane and STW-9 Perth. Packer later bought the network back for half of what he sold it for in 1990."

Biomet;Health care equipment & services;"Biomet, Inc., was a medical device manufacturer located in the Warsaw, Indiana, business cluster. The company specialized in reconstructive products for orthopedic surgery, neurosurgery, craniomaxillofacial surgery and operating room supplies. In 2015, Biomet became part of the new company Zimmer Biomet.


== History ==
Biomet was established in 1977 and delivered its first hip replacement in 1978. The four founders of Biomet were: Dane A. Miller, Ray Harroff, Niles Noblitt, and Jerry Ferguson.  In a September 2007 club deal, the company was acquired by a consortium of private equity firms consisting of The Blackstone Group, Goldman Sachs, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts L.P. and TPG Capital, after which Biomet ceased trading on NASDAQ.
In April 2014, it was announced that Zimmer Holdings had succeeded in a bid to acquire Biomet for a fee of $13.4 billion. However, in October 2014, EU antitrust regulators opened an investigation into Zimmer's bid on the grounds that the deal may lead to substantial decreases in competition in certain markets. The verdict of the investigation into the deal that would make Zimmer the world's second-largest seller of orthopaedic products behind Johnson & Johnson allowed the merger to take place in June 2015.


== Products ==
Biomet manufactured reconstructive products for orthopedic surgery, such as hips, knees and shoulders, fixation devices, orthopedic support devices. It also made spinal implants, dental implants, and general operating instruments."
China Development Finl;Banking;"The economy of Japan is a highly developed mixed economy, often referred to as an East Asian model. According to the IMF forecast for 2025, it will be the fifth-largest economy in the world by nominal GDP as well as by purchasing power parity (PPP) by the end of the year. It constituted 3.7% of the world's economy on a nominal basis in 2024. According to the same forecast, the country's per capita GDP (PPP) will be $54,678 (2025). Due to a volatile currency exchange rate, Japan's nominal GDP as measured in American dollars fluctuates sharply.
A founding member of the G7 and an early member of the OECD, Japan was the first country in Asia to achieve developed country status. In 2018, Japan was the fourth-largest in the world both as an importer and as an exporter. The country also has the world's fourth-largest consumer market. Japan used to run a considerable trade surplus, but the decline of the manufacturing sector since the 1980s and increased fossil fuel imports after the Fukushima nuclear accident in 2011 have changed this trend in recent years. Being the world's largest creditor nation, Japan has a considerable net international investment surplus."
Alliant Energy;Utilities;"Alliant Energy Corporation is a public utility holding company headquartered in Madison, Wisconsin, providing power in Iowa and Wisconsin.


== History ==
Interstate Power and Light Company (IPL) expanded greatly in the late 1920s to include operations in Iowa, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and Manitoba (Canada). One of the largest purchases in the late 1920s was the purchase of what became its northern Minnesota territory from the Wilbur Foshay interests.
In the 1930s and 1940s, the effects of the Depression and passage of laws to regulate utility operations at the state and federal level had an effect on IPC as well as its neighbors. In Iowa, the legislature passed laws making it easier for cities to establish municipal utilities (and indeed, there are over 100 municipal utilities in Iowa today). By 1940, the state of Nebraska had passed laws that forced all investor-owned utilities in that state to sell their operations to one of several ""public power districts"" operating in that state.
During the 1940s, IPC divested itself of all its operations that were not part of its main territory in southern MN / northern Iowa. The largest chunk of territory was that operating in northeast ND / northern MN / Emerson, Manitoba which was sold in summer 1943 and fall 1944. The SD properties (around Winner) were sold in 1946. It would not be until 1956 when the last isolated district ‚Äî the area around Waconia, MN ‚Äî was sold to Northern States Power."

== History ==
The company was founded in 1856 by Thomas James Smith of Kingston upon Hull who went into business as a dispensing chemist. One early product line that the firm specialised in was cod liver oil; by 1858, it had effectively shifted from retail to wholesale to supply cod liver oil (and other productions) to hospitals, dispensaries, and the wider medical profession.
A few months before his death in 1896, Smith was joined by his nephew, Horatio Nelson Smith, at which point the business became known as T. J. Smith and Nephew. Horatio reoriented the firm from cod liver oil in favour of other products; during 1904, it started producing and supplying bandages and surgical dressings. This new product line experienced high demand following the outbreak of the First World War during 1914, during which its dressings were routinely used to treat wounded soldiers.
It was amid this war that Horatio met with French President Raymond Poincar√©, after which the company received its largest-ever order after it was awarded a contract valued at ¬£350,000 to supply both surgical and field dressings, which it successfully fulfilled within five months."

George Wimpey;Construction;"George Wimpey Limited was a British construction firm that typically worked in the civil engineering and housebuilding markets. It was, during the 1970s, the largest homebuilder active in the UK. 
Established in 1880 and originally based in Hammersmith, the company's early activities were orientated around its road surfacing contractor role, as well as civil engineering, such as the construction of the White City Stadium complex and similar facilities. Following the death of George Wimpey in 1913, the business was acquired from the Wimpey family by Godfrey Mitchell in 1919. Mitchell would head the company for over half a century, making several key decisions such as to enter the private housebuilding sector during the 1920s. During 1934, George Wimpey went public on the London Stock Exchange; however, an unusual ownership scheme was enacted, under which the charitable Tudor Trust held about half of the firm's shares, an arrangement that lasted for several decades.
Throughout the Second World War, Wimpey contributed to the war effort through the construction of numerous airfields, factories, and other facilities to meet Britain's needs. After the war, the company secured substantial work from various local authorities to produce houses. It played a leading role in the use of no-fines concrete construction to produce new homes. Throughout the 1950s and the following two decades, Wimpey's building and civil engineering divisions expanded substantially, not just domestically but internationally as well, to the point that the firm became one of Britain's larger international contractors. A return to private homebuilding and a series of lucrative opportunities, particularly in the Middle East, had fuelled the company's growth."

== History ==
Cosmo in Japan traces its corporate roots to Maruzen Petroleum (‰∏∏ÂñÑÁü≥Ê≤πÊ†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ), a company established in 1931, although the oil business operated by Maruzen was originally established by Zenzo Matsumura in Kobe in 1907.
Cosmo Oil Company was formed on April 1, 1986, through the merger of Maruzen Petroleum and Daikyo Petroleum, a group of oil businesses based in Niigata Prefecture, which merged in 1939.
A major fire occurred at the Cosmo refinery in Ichihara, as a result of the 2011 T≈çhoku earthquake. It was extinguished after ten days, injuring six people and destroying storage tanks  The ultimate cause was traced to the collapse of supports for LPG Tank 364, which had been filled with water and undergoing hydrostatic testing at the time the earthquake struck.  The collapse fractured LPG pipes, releasing gas that then ignited, in turn igniting LPG in several adjacent tanks.
In February 2015, the company said it will reorganize itself under a holding company to boost profitability. Also in 2015, in March, Cosmo Oil formed an LPG joint-venture, by merging its LPG business with three other company's LPG units. The new company, named Gyxis Corporation, started effective operations on April 1, 2015."

Showa Denko;Chemicals;"Resonance is a phenomenon that occurs when an object or system is subjected to an external force or vibration that matches its resonant frequency (or resonance frequency), defined as the frequency that generates the maximum amplitude response in the system. When this happens, the object or system absorbs energy from the external force and starts vibrating with a larger amplitude. Resonance can occur in various systems, such as mechanical, electrical, or acoustic systems, and it is often desirable in certain applications, such as musical instruments or radio receivers. However, resonance can also be detrimental, leading to excessive vibrations or even structural failure in some cases. 
All systems, including molecular systems and particles, tend to vibrate at a natural frequency depending upon their structure; when there is very little damping this frequency is approximately equal to, but slightly above, the resonant frequency. When an oscillating force, an external vibration, is applied at a resonant frequency of a dynamic system, object, or particle, the outside vibration will cause the system to oscillate at a higher amplitude (with more force) than when the same force is applied at other, non-resonant frequencies.
The resonant frequencies of a system can be identified when the response to an external vibration creates an amplitude that is a relative maximum within the system. Small periodic forces that are near a resonant frequency of the system have the ability to produce large amplitude oscillations in the system due to the storage of vibrational energy.
Resonance phenomena occur with all types of vibrations or waves: there is mechanical resonance, orbital resonance, acoustic resonance, electromagnetic resonance, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron spin resonance (ESR) and resonance of quantum wave functions.

In recent years, coordinated patrols by Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Singapore along with increased security on vessels have sparked a sharp downturn in piracy.
The Strait of Malacca's geography makes the region very susceptible to piracy. It was and still is an important passageway between China and India, used heavily for commercial trade. The strait is on the route between Europe, the Suez Canal, the oil-exporting countries of the Persian Gulf, and the busy ports of East Asia. It is narrow, contains thousands of islets, and is an outlet for many rivers, making it ideal for pirates to evade capture.


== History ==
Piracy in the Strait of Malacca was not only a lucrative way of life but also an important political tool.  Rulers relied on the region's pirates to maintain control. For example, it was through the loyalty of Orang Laut pirate crews that the 14th-century Palembang prince Parameswara survived expansion attempts by neighbouring rulers and eventually went on to found the Sultanate of Malacca.
Piracy in the region was mentioned in Chinese texts; for example, the 14th century traveller Wang Dayuan described pirates from Long Ya Men (in present-day Singapore) and Lambri (in Northern Sumatra) in his work Daoyi Zhil√ºe."

Taylor Woodrow;Construction;"Taylor Woodrow  was one of the largest housebuilding and general construction companies in Britain. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index until its merger with rival housebuilder George Wimpey to create Taylor Wimpey on 3 July 2007.
Taylor Woodrow was created from the work of Frank Taylor and his uncle, Jack Woodrow; Frank started building homes in Blackpool at the age of 16 in 1921. During 1930, the company relocated to London and rapidly increased its activities in the private housing market as well as entering the general construction sector as well. In 1935, the various housebuilding companies were amalgamated and floated on the London Stock Exchange as Taylor Woodrow Estates. Taylor Woodrow Construction formed two years later. Private housebuilding was halted during the Second World War; instead, the company built various military facilities and factories to support the British war effort.
By the conflict's end, Taylor Woodrow was a substantial construction company; it quickly spread internationally and engaged in a wide variety of work, both for the private and public sectors. During the 1950s and 1960s, it was involved in the construction of the world's first commercial nuclear power station (Calder Hall), the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral, and the St Katharine Docks complex. Between the 1950s and the beginning of the 1980s, while Taylor Woodrow was involved in private housebuilding, it was a relatively small endeavour in comparison to its other activities."

mg technologies;Chemicals;"G, or g, is the seventh letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages, and others worldwide. Its name in English is gee (pronounced  ), plural gees.
The lowercase version can be written in two forms: the single-storey (sometimes ""opentail"")  and the double-storey (sometimes ""looptail"") . The former is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children.


== History ==

The evolution of the Latin alphabet's G can be traced back to the Latin alphabet's predecessor, the Greek alphabet. The voiced velar stop was represented by the third letter of the Greek alphabet, gamma (Œì), which was later adopted by the Etruscan language. Latin then borrowed this ""rounded form"" of gamma, C, to represent the same sound in words such as recei, which was likely an early dative form of rex, meaning ""king"", as found in an ""early Latin inscription."" Over time, however, the letter C shifted to represent the voiceless velar stop, leading to the displacement of the letter K. Scholars believe that this change can be attributed to the influence of the Etruscan language on Latin. 
Afterwards, the letter 'G' was introduced in the Old Latin period as a variant of 'C' to distinguish voiced /…°/ from voiceless /k/, and G was used to represent a voiced velar stop from this point on and C ""stood for the unvoiced velar only"".
The recorded originator of 'G' is freedman Spurius Carvilius Ruga, who added letter G to the teaching of the Roman alphabet during the 3rd century BCE: he was the first Roman to open a fee-paying school, around 230 BCE. At this time, 'K' had fallen out of favor, and 'C', which had formerly represented both /…°/ and /k/ before open vowels, had come to express /k/ in all environments.
Ruga's positioning of 'G' shows that alphabetic order related to the letters' values as Greek numerals was a concern even in the 3rd century BCE. According to some records, the original seventh letter, 'Z', had been purged from the Latin alphabet somewhat earlier in the 3rd century BCE by the Roman censor Appius Claudius, who found it distasteful and foreign."

UST;Food drink & tobacco;"Rust is an iron oxide, a usually reddish-brown oxide formed by the reaction of iron and oxygen in the catalytic presence of water or air moisture. Rust consists of hydrous iron(III) oxides (Fe2O3¬∑nH2O) and iron(III) oxide-hydroxide (FeO(OH), Fe(OH)3), and is typically associated with the corrosion of refined iron.
Given sufficient time, any iron mass, in the presence of water and oxygen, could eventually convert entirely to rust. Surface rust is commonly flaky and friable, and provides no passivational protection to the underlying iron, unlike the formation of patina on copper surfaces. Rusting is the common term for corrosion of elemental iron and its alloys such as steel. Many other metals undergo similar corrosion, but the resulting oxides are not commonly called ""rust"".
Several forms of rust are distinguishable both visually and by spectroscopy, and form under different circumstances. Other forms of rust include the result of reactions between iron and chloride in an environment deprived of oxygen. Rebar used in underwater concrete pillars, which generates green rust, is an example. Although rusting is generally a negative aspect of iron, a particular form of rusting, known as stable rust, causes the object to have a thin coating of rust over the top."

First Financial Holding;Banking;"The Rakuten Monkeys (Chinese: Ê®ÇÂ§©Ê°ÉÁåø; pinyin: L√®tiƒÅn T√°oy√∫an), formerly known as La New Bears (2004‚Äì2010) and Lamigo Monkeys (2011‚Äì2019), are a professional baseball team in the Chinese Professional Baseball League (CPBL) in Taiwan. Owned and administered by the Japanese technology conglomerate Rakuten, the Monkeys qualified for the playoffs in 2006 for the first time in team history, and by finishing with the best record in the entire season, gained an automatic berth for the Taiwan Series.
The team played their home games at Chengcing Lake Baseball Field in Kaohsiung County from 2004 to 2010. In the 2011 season, they moved to Taoyuan International Baseball Stadium. Accordingly, the team's name was changed to the Lamigo Monkeys.

=== First Financial Holdings Agan (2003) ===
First known as the First Securities Agan, the team was owned by the First Financial Holding Corporation, a government-funded financial holding service institute. Its then-chairman Chen Chien-lung was a keen political supporter of President Chen Shui-bian, and, upon the president's request, immediately agreed to take over one of the two former TML teams after TML was merged into CPBL in January 2003. Since Macoto Bank had already decided to take-over the Macoto Gida, Chen Chien-lung took over the Agan as promised. The majority of Agan's player came from Taipei Gida and Kaohsiung-Pingtung Fala, and not from the Taichung Agan, which carried the same mascot and were the champions of the final season of TML. Agan played its home games at Chengcing Lake Baseball Field.
After Chen Chien-lung's sudden resignation due to allegation of insider trading in August 2003, the First Financial Holding Corporation no longer showed willingness in running the team."

Canadian Tire;Retailing;"Canada is divided into six time zones: Pacific, Mountain, Central, Eastern, Atlantic and Newfoundland  time. Most areas of the country's provinces and territories operate on standard time from the first Sunday in November to the second Sunday in March and daylight saving time the rest of the year.
The divisions between time zones are based on proposals by Scottish Canadian railway engineer Sandford Fleming, who pioneered the use of the 24-hour clock, the world's time zone system, and a standard prime meridian.


== Official time ==

The National Research Council (NRC) maintains Canada's official time through the use of atomic clocks. The official time is specified in legislation passed by the individual provinces. In Quebec it is based on coordinated universal time. The other provinces use mean solar time. The NRC provides both coordinated universal time and mean solar time in its signals. It makes time servers available for direct synchronization with computers. The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation aired a daily time signal, the National Research Council Time Signal, beginning November 5, 1939."
Impala Platinum Holdings;Materials;"Impala Platinum Holdings Limited or Implats is a South African holding company that owns several companies which operate mines that produce platinum and platinum group metals, as well as nickel, copper and cobalt. Its most significant mine is the Impala mine in the North West province of South Africa. The company also owns or has interest in the Two Rivers mine and the Marula mine in the South Africa Bushveld Igneous Complex and the Mimosa mine and Zimplats in Zimbabwe, as well as the Impala Refining Services which smelts and refines metals for other companies. In December 2019, Impala Canada was formed, owned by the holding company, out of the acquisition of North American Palladium and its mine in Ontario, Canada.


== History ==
Implats was formed in 1966 as a subsidiary of Union Corporation, which established a platinum mine in Rustenburg with an initial capacity of 100,000 oz per year. It received technical advice from Canadian company Inco, while British bank Hambros provided financial advice. The two, along with South African state-owned Industrial Development Corporation, each took a 10% share in the company. In 1968, Implats entered into a prospecting accord with the Bafokeng tribe (now the Royal Bafokeng Nation) and obtained a lease for 12,000 ha of land, with production kicking off in July 1969.
During the 1970s, legislation introducing new vehicle emission standards worldwide, including those introduced and pursued in the U.S. by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), increased global demand for platinum. In 1974, Implats began supplying major motor manufacturer General Motors with up to 300,000 t oz of platinum and 120,000  t oz of palladium a year for devices to reduce exhaust pollution."

Due to a declining market for publication paper, the company has increasingly focused on other uses of timber and recycled paper, such as packaging. The company is headquartered in Norway and has factories in five countries and an annual production of approximately 2 million tonnes of paper (2020).


== History ==
Norske Skog started in 1962 with the construction of a paper mill at Skogn in Norway, with the plant opening in 1966 and a second paper machine added in 1967. Half the capital for the project was issued by the Norwegian Forest Owners Association. In 1972 Norske Skog started a cooperation with Follum Fabrikker in H√∏nefoss. By 1989 Norske Skog had acquired Follum Fabrikker and Union in Skien as well as Saugbrugsforeningen in Halden. With this Norske Skog controlled all the pulp and paper mills in Norway.
The first international acquisition came in 1992 with Norske Skog Golbey in Lorraine, France."

The company suffered a series of downgrades in 2004, despite good business performance.  The company lashed out at ratings agencies saying that the downgrades ""harmed our franchise"".
In 2007 the company was purchased by Scor, after becoming the target of a hostile takeover in February. Martin Ebner, together with the Z√ºrcher Kantonalbank, helped the French reinsurer Scor to build up a position of almost 33 percent with a controversial option deal and contributed to Converium's management collapsing in its defensive struggle."
Weatherford Intl;Oil & gas operations;"Ireland's Corporate Tax System is a central component of Ireland's economy.  In 2016‚Äì17, foreign firms paid 80% of Irish corporate tax, employed 25% of the Irish labour force (paid 50% of Irish salary tax), and created 57% of Irish OECD non-farm value-add.  As of 2017, 25 of the top 50 Irish firms were U.S.‚Äìcontrolled businesses, representing 70% of the revenue of the top 50 Irish firms.  By 2018, Ireland had received the most U.S. ¬ß Corporate tax inversions in history, and Apple was over one‚Äìfifth of Irish GDP. Academics rank Ireland as the largest tax haven; larger than the Caribbean tax haven system.
Ireland's ""headline"" corporation tax rate is 12.5%, however, foreign multinationals pay an aggregate ¬ß Effective tax rate (ETR) of 2.2‚Äì4.5% on global profits ""shifted"" to Ireland, via Ireland's global network of bilateral tax treaties.  These lower effective tax rates are achieved by a complex set of Irish base erosion and profit shifting (""BEPS"") tools which handle the largest BEPS flows in the world (e.g. the Double Irish as used by Google and Facebook, the Single Malt as used by Microsoft and Allergan, and Capital Allowances for Intangible Assets as used by Accenture, and by Apple post Q1 2015).
Ireland's main ¬ß Multinational tax schemes use ""intellectual property"" (""IP"") accounting to affect the BEPS movement, which is why almost all foreign multinationals in Ireland are from the industries with substantial IP, namely technology and life sciences.

Ireland's GDP is artificially inflated by BEPS accounting flows.  This distortion escalated in Q1 2015 when Apple executed the largest BEPS transaction in history, on-shoring $300 billion of non‚ÄìU.S. IP to Ireland (resulting in a phenomenon dubbed by some as ""leprechaun economics"")."

=== Founding and early growth ===
In April 1889, the H√∂rder Bergwerks- und H√ºtten-Verein founded the Rheinische Metallwaren- und Maschinenfabrik Aktiengesellschaft under General Director Josef Massenez, to produce ammunition for the German Empire. The Thuringian engineer Heinrich Ehrhardt (1840-1928) oversaw the construction of the Rheinmetall plant in D√ºsseldorf and managed it until 1920. He made many of his patents and inventions available to the company and contributed significantly to the technical development of many Rheinmetall products. In December 1889, the newly founded factory in D√ºsseldorf-Derendorf on Ulmenstra√üe began production.
The company expanded very quickly in the following years, partly due to government orders and partly because patents were obtained for two processes for manufacturing seamless tubes in 1891 and 1892. In order to meet the increased demand for steel resulting from the expansion of the main plant, Metallwerk Ehrhardt & Heye AG in D√ºsseldorf-Rath was acquired in 1892 and incorporated into the company in 1896."

GAIL (India);Utilities;"A prison, also known as a jail, gaol, penitentiary, detention center, correction center, correctional facility, remand center, hoosegow, big house, or slammer, is a facility where people are imprisoned under the authority of the state, usually as punishment for various crimes. They may also be used to house those awaiting trial (pre-trial detention). Prisons are most commonly used within a criminal-justice system by authorities: people charged with crimes may be imprisoned until their trial; and those who have pleaded or been found guilty of crimes at trial may be sentenced to a specified period of imprisonment.
Prisons can also be used as a tool for political repression by authoritarian regimes who detain perceived opponents for political crimes, often without a fair trial or due process; this use is illegal under most forms of international law governing fair administration of justice. In times of war, belligerents or neutral countries may detain prisoners of war or detainees in military prisons or in prisoner-of-war camps. At any time, states may imprison civilians ‚Äì sometimes large groups of civilians ‚Äì in internment camps.

Mylan Labs;Drugs & biotechnology;"Hua Mulan (Chinese: Ëä±Êú®Ëò≠) is a legendary Chinese folk heroine from the Northern and Southern dynasties era (4th to 6th century CE) of Chinese history. Scholars generally consider Mulan to be a fictional character. Hua Mulan is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (ÁÑ°ÈõôË≠ú, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.


== Overview ==
According to legend, Mulan took her aged father's place in the conscription for the army by disguising herself as a man. In the story, after prolonged and distinguished military service against nomadic hordes beyond the northern frontier, Mulan is honored by the emperor, but she declines a position of high office. She retires to her hometown, where she is reunited with her family and, much to the astonishment of her comrades, reveals herself as a woman.


== First mentions ==
The first written record of Mulan is the Ballad of Mulan, a folk song believed to have been composed during the Northern Wei dynasty (386‚Äì535 CE) and included in an anthology of books and songs during the Southern Chen dynasty (557‚Äì589 CE). While this anthology is itself lost, significant excerpts, including the Ballad of Mulan, survive in the Song dynasty anthology Yuefu Shiji‚Ää (Chinese: Ê®ÇÂ∫úË©©ÈõÜ). 
The historical setting of the Ballad of Mulan is usually the Northern Wei's military campaigns against the nomadic Rouran. A later adaptation has Mulan active around the founding of the Tang dynasty (c.‚Äâ620 CE)."

Continental Airlines;Transportation;"Continental Airlines (simply known as Continental) was a major airline in the United States that operated from 1934 until it merged with United Airlines in 2012. It had ownership interests and brand partnerships with several carriers.
Continental started out as one of the smaller carriers in the United States, known for its limited operations under the regulated era that provided very fine, almost fancy, service against the larger majors in important point-to-point markets, the largest of which was Chicago/Los Angeles. However, deregulation in 1978 changed the competitive landscape and realities, as noted by Smithsonian Airline Historian R. E. G. Davies, ""Unfortunately, the policies that had been successful for more than forty years under (Robert) Six's cavalier style of management were suddenly laid bare as the cold winds of airline deregulation changed all the rules‚Äîspecifically, the balance between revenues and expenditures.""
In 1981, Texas International Airlines acquired a controlling interest in Continental.  The companies were merged in 1982, moved to Houston, and grew into one of the country's largest carriers despite facing financial and labor issues, eventually becoming one of the more successful airlines in the United States.
Continental and United Airlines merged in an $8.5 billion all-stock merger of equals on October 1, 2010. Continental's shareholders received 1.05 per share in United stock for each Continental share they owned.

Since 30 July 2008, the company has been a wholly owned subsidiary of automotive navigation system manufacturer TomTom.


== Operations ==
The company provides maps, some sourced from other mapping companies, covering two hundred countries around the world, providing mapping data and ""Map Enhancement Products"" such as points of interest and address points. Clients of Tele Atlas include makers of automotive navigation systems as well as mobile and internet companies which provide mapping services. The firm also supplies data to clients in the public and private sectors who rely on geographic information.


== Mapping vans ==

The company keeps its data up-to-date in part through a fleet of dozens of mapping vans equipped with ""six cameras, two side-sweeping lasers and a GPS navigation device.""  The vans capture about three photos per second while traveling at normal speeds, resulting in more than 100 million images per year from each van; the images are stored on one of two hard disk drives within a metal cabinet inside the van, drives that hold about two weeks of data.   Meanwhile, the 3-D scanning lasers record the width, height and contours of the first reflective surface they encounter, producing data that when combined with the images create a three-dimension representation.  Three-dimension representations are already available in Japan and Western Europe; employees at the company's U.S. headquarters in Lebanon, New Hampshire, near Dartmouth College,  expected in August 2009 that by the beginning of 2011, devices based on Tele Atlas data would be able to depict the surroundings in photo-realistic detail.


== Map error handling ==

The idea is to let end users report errors directly to Tele Atlas, not via the technical support of the manufacturers of products using Tele Atlas maps, and thereby reducing support costs."

Its brands included Avantis, Eurotherm, Foxboro, IMServ, InFusion, Triconex, SimSci, Skelta, Wonderware, Drayton, Eberle, and Eliwell.
Less than three years after its establishment, Invensys was in financial hardship, in part due to having overpaid for acquisitions such as the Baan Corporation at the height of the dotcom bubble and having accumulated a heavy debt burden. Through several divestments and a major restructuring, the company's fiscal situation had improved by 2005, allowing the pace of acquisitions to pick up. Considerable business was being obtained by its various products in the railway sector, which it opted to align under the Invensys Rail brand. Invensys Rail was ultimately sold to the German engineering conglomerate Siemens in exchange for ¬£1.7 billion in May 2013."

The dyne is defined as ""the force required to accelerate a mass of one gram at a rate of one centimetre per second squared"". An equivalent definition of the dyne is ""that force which, acting for one second, will produce a change of velocity of one centimetre per second in a mass of one gram"".  
One dyne is equal to 10 micronewtons, 10‚àí5 N or to 10 nsn (nanosthenes) in the old metre‚Äìtonne‚Äìsecond system of units. 

1 dyn = 1 g‚ãÖcm/s2 = 10‚àí5 kg‚ãÖm/s2 = 10‚àí5 N
1 N = 1 kg‚ãÖm/s2 = 105 g‚ãÖcm/s2 = 105 dyn


== Use ==
The dyne per centimetre is a unit traditionally used to measure surface tension. For example, the surface tension of distilled water is 71.99 dyn/cm at 25 ¬∞C (77 ¬∞F)."

Pioneer Natural Res;Oil & gas operations;"Natural science or empirical science is one of the branches of science concerned with the description, understanding and prediction of natural phenomena, based on empirical evidence from observation and experimentation. Mechanisms such as peer review and reproducibility of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.
Natural science can be divided into two main branches: life science and physical science. Life science is alternatively known as biology. Physical science is subdivided into branches: physics, astronomy, Earth science and chemistry. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields). As empirical sciences, natural sciences use tools from the formal sciences, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements that can be explained as clear statements of the ""laws of nature"".
Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to natural philosophy. Galileo, Kepler, Descartes, Bacon, and Newton debated the benefits of using approaches which were more mathematical and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, conjectures, and presuppositions, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science."

Tupras-Turkiye Petrol;Oil & gas operations;"T√ºrkiye Petrol Rafinerileri A.≈û. is a company in Turkey, operating four refineries with a total capacity to handle an annual 30 mn tons of crude.


== Introduction ==
T√ºpra≈ü operates four oil refineries, three of which process imported crude. The 11 million tonnes a year Izmit refinery at Izmit in north-west Turkey and the 11 million tonnes/yr Izmir refinery at Aliaga on Turkey's central Aegean coast process crude from global markets delivered by tanker while the 5 million tonnes/yr Kirikkale refinery at Kirrikale in central Turkey processes crude delivered to Turkey's Mediterranean oil hub at Ceyhan and transited to the refinery via a bespoke pipeline.
The fourth refinery, the 1.1 million tonnes/yr batman refinery processes crude produced a myriad small oil fields in south-east Turkey delivered to the refinery both via an existing pipeline network and by road tanker.
Tupras also owns a majority stake (79.98%) in the shipping company Dƒ∞TA≈û and, since 2006, a 40% ownership of petrol retailer Opet.
The company's origins go back to ƒ∞PRA≈û (ƒ∞stanbul Petrol Rafinerisi A.≈û.) established by the U.S. Caltex Company (now part of Chevron).  In 1983, ƒ∞PRA≈û and three other publicly owned refineries were brought into state control under the T√ºpra≈ü umbrella.  Partial privatisation started in 1991, when an IPO sold 2.5% of shares to the public; by 2005 a number of secondary issues had taken this up to 49%.  In 2005, a consortium of Ko√ß Holding and Shell bid over $4billion to acquire the 51% interest remaining; this was through a new joint venture company, Enerji Yatƒ±rƒ±mlarƒ± A.≈û. The company‚Äôs shares were divided among the shareholders as follows: Ko√ß Holding A.≈û. 75%, Aygaz A.≈û. 20%, OPET Petrolc√ºl√ºk A.≈û. 3%, Shell Overseas Investment B.V. 1.9% and the Shell Company of Turkey Ltd. 0.1%."
LG Corp;Chemicals;"L, or l, is the twelfth letter of the Latin alphabet, used in the modern English alphabet, the alphabets of other western European languages and others worldwide. Its name in English is el (pronounced   EL), plural els.


== History ==

Lamedh may have come from a pictogram of an ox goad or cattle prod. Some have suggested that it represents a shepherd's staff.


=== Typographic variants ===

In most sans-serif typefaces, the lowercase letter ell ‚ü®l‚ü©, written as the glyph l, may be difficult to distinguish from the uppercase letter ""eye"" ‚ü®I‚ü© (written as the glyph I); in some serif typefaces, the glyph l may be confused with the glyph 1, the digit one. To avoid such confusion, some newer computer fonts (such as Trebuchet MS) have a finial, a curve to the right at the bottom of the lowercase letter ell. Other style variants are provided in script typefaces and display typefaces. All these variants of the letter are encoded in Unicode as U+004C L LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L or U+006C l LATIN SMALL LETTER L, allowing presentation to be chosen according to each context. For specialist mathematical and scientific use, there are a number of dedicated codepoints in the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols block.
In the Romain du Roi, where the ascenders of lowercase letters have symmetrical serifs at the top, l has an extra serif to the left at the mean line to distinguish it from capital I.
Another means of reducing such confusion is to use symbol ‚Ñì, which is a cursive, handwriting-style lowercase form of the letter ""ell""."

Acer;Technology hardware & equipment;"The acre ( AY-k…ôr) is a unit of land area used in the British imperial and the United States customary systems. It is traditionally defined as the area of one chain by one furlong (66 by 660 feet), which is exactly equal to 10 square chains, 1‚ÅÑ640 of a square mile, 4,840 square yards, or 43,560 square feet, and approximately 4,047 m2, or about 40% of a hectare. Based upon the international yard and pound agreement of 1959, an acre may be declared as exactly 4,046.8564224 square metres. The acre is sometimes abbreviated ac, but is usually spelled out as the word ""acre"".
Traditionally, in the Middle Ages, an acre was conceived of as the area of land that could be ploughed by one man using a team of eight oxen in one day. The acre is still a statutory measure in the United States. Both the international acre and the US survey acre are in use, but they differ by only four parts per million. The most common use of the acre is to measure tracts of land. The acre is used in many established and former Commonwealth of Nations countries by custom. In a few, it continues as a statute measure, although not since 2010 in the UK, and not for decades in Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa."

It aims to implement the eco-socialist and democratic socialist programme L'Avenir en commun (transl.‚ÄâA Shared Future). The party utilises the lower case Greek letter phi as its logotype.
The party nominated M√©lenchon as its candidate for the 2017 French presidential election.

Following Lewis Greensitt's departure, the company was rebranded as Barratt Developments. It grew rapidly during the 1970s, largely due to a spree of acquisitions. By June 1983, Barratt was the largest housebuilder in the country, selling a record 16,500 houses over the prior 12 months. Sales more than halved during the mid-1980s, a trend that was partly attributed to public criticism of Barratt's practices in two successive ITV World in Action programmes."
Universal Health;Health care equipment & services;"Universal health care (also called universal health coverage, universal coverage, or universal care) is a health care system in which all residents of a particular country or region are assured access to health care. It is generally organized around providing either all residents or only those who cannot afford on their own, with either health services or the means to acquire them, with the end goal of improving health outcomes.
Some universal healthcare systems are government-funded, while others are based on a requirement that all citizens purchase private health insurance. Universal healthcare can be determined by three critical dimensions: who is covered, what services are covered, and how much of the cost is covered. It is described by the World Health Organization as a situation where citizens can access health services without incurring financial hardship. Then-Director General of the WHO Margaret Chan described universal health coverage as the ""single most powerful concept that public health has to offer"" since it unifies ""services and delivers them in a comprehensive and integrated way"". One of the goals with universal healthcare is to create a system of protection which provides equality of opportunity for people to enjoy the highest possible level of health. Critics say that universal healthcare leads to longer wait times and worse quality healthcare.
As part of Sustainable Development Goals, United Nations member states have agreed to work toward worldwide universal health coverage by 2030. Therefore, the inclusion of the universal health coverage (UHC) within the SDGs targets can be related to the reiterated endorsements operated by the WHO.

AmerUs Group;Insurance;"Aviv (Hebrew: ◊ê◊ë◊ô◊ë) means ""spring (season)"" in Hebrew. Aviv is the first month of the year in the Pentateuch, and is later called Nisan in the book of Esther and in subsequent post-exilic history up to the present day. These names are sometimes used interchangeably, although Aviv refers to the three-month season, and Nisan is called the ""first month of Aviv."" Aviv is also used as a given name, surname, and place name, as in Tel Aviv.  


== Meanings ==
The basic meaning of the word aviv is the stage in the growth of grain when the seeds have reached full size and are filled with starch, but have not dried yet. During the plague of hail (Exodus 9:31), the barley was said to be [in the] aviv [stage] and the flax [in the] giv`ol. This resulted in their destruction.
The month in the Hebrew calendar when the barley has reached or passed this stage is called Aviv, or the ""month of the aviv"". This month is considered the first month of the ecclesiastical civil year (see Hebrew calendar#Months). It begins about the time of the March equinox (March 21). Since the Babylonian captivity, this month has mainly been called Nisan."

Sonae SGPS;Conglomerates;"Sonar (sound navigation and ranging or sonic navigation and ranging) is a technique that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, measure distances (ranging), communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water, such as other vessels.
""Sonar"" can refer to one of two types of technology: passive sonar means listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar means emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of ""targets"" in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used for robot navigation, and sodar (an upward-looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (infrasonic) to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.
The first recorded use of the technique was in 1490 by Leonardo da Vinci, who used a tube inserted into the water to detect vessels by ear. It was developed during World War I to counter the growing threat of submarine warfare, with an operational passive sonar system in use by 1918."

Clariant;Chemicals;"The clarinet is a single-reed musical instrument in the woodwind family, with a nearly cylindrical bore and a flared bell.
Clarinets comprise a family of instruments of differing sizes and pitches. The clarinet family is the largest woodwind family, ranging from the BB‚ô≠ contrabass to the A‚ô≠ piccolo. The B‚ô≠ soprano clarinet is the most common type, and is the instrument usually indicated by the word ""clarinet"".
German instrument maker Johann Christoph Denner is generally credited with inventing the clarinet sometime around 1700 by adding a register key to the chalumeau, an earlier single-reed instrument. Over time, additional keywork and airtight pads were added to improve the tone and playability. Today the clarinet is a standard fixture of the orchestra and concert band and is used in classical music, military bands, klezmer, jazz, and other styles.

The word ""clarinet"" may have entered the English language via the French clarinette (the feminine diminutive of Old French clarin), or from Proven√ßal clarin 'oboe', originating from the Latin root clarus 'clear'. The word is related to Middle English clarion, a type of trumpet, the name of which derives from the same root.
The earliest mention of the word ""clarinette"" being used for the instrument dates to a 1710 order placed by the Duke of Gronsfeld for two instruments made by Jacob Denner."

Industrivarden;Construction;"Polo  is a ball game that is played on horseback as a traditional field sport. It is one of the world's oldest known team sports, having been adopted in the Western world from the game of Chovgan (Persian: ⁄ÜŸà⁄ØÿßŸÜ), which originated in ancient Iran, dating back over 2,000 years. Initially played by Persian nobility as a training exercise for cavalry units, polo eventually spread to other parts of the world. The game is played by two opposing teams with the objective of scoring using a long-handled wooden mallet to hit a small hard ball through the opposing team's goal. Each team has four mounted riders, and the game usually lasts one to two hours, divided into periods called chukkas or chukkers.
Polo has been called ""The Sport of Kings"" and has become a spectator sport for equestrians and high society, often supported by sponsorship. The progenitor of polo and its variants existed from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD, as an equestrian game played by the Iranian peoples.

He founded his own manufacturing business, the Crown Cork and Seal Company, in Baltimore and set out on a campaign to convince bottlers that his cap was the right one to use on their products. By 1898, he had created a foot-powered crowner device to sell to bottlers and retailers so that they could seal the bottles with his caps quickly and easily. This helped gain acceptance of his bottle caps."

=== Early years ===
In 1978, John Mackey and Renee Lawson borrowed $45,000 from family and friends to open a small vegetarian natural foods store called SaferWay in Austin, Texas (the name being a spoof of Safeway). When the two were evicted for storing food products in their apartment, they decided to live at the store. Because it was zoned for commercial use, there was no shower stall, so they bathed using a water hose attached to their dishwasher.
Two years later, Mackey and Lawson partnered with Craig Weller and Mark Skiles to merge SaferWay with the latter's Clarksville Natural Grocery, resulting in the opening of the original Whole Foods Market, which included meat products. At 10,500 square feet (980 m2) and with a staff of 19, the store was large in comparison to the standard health food store of the time."

Hiroshima Bank;Banking;"Human Shadow Etched in Stone (‰∫∫ÂΩ±„ÅÆÁü≥, hitokage no ishi) is an exhibition at the Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum. It is thought to be the shadow of a person who was sitting at the entrance of Hiroshima Branch of Sumitomo Bank when the atomic bomb was dropped over Hiroshima. It is also known as Human Shadow of Death or simply the Blast Shadow.


== Background ==

On the morning of August 6, 1945, the Little Boy atomic bomb was detonated at an altitude of 1,968 ¬± 50 feet (600 ¬± 15 m) over the city of Hiroshima, near the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. Among its other effects, it subjected the ground area to extremely high radiant temperatures for several seconds (higher than 1800 ¬∞C/3270 ¬∞F for less than 4 seconds). Because the duration of this high-temperature burn is so short, it does not have time to diffuse or be dissipated by thermal diffusion, leading to a situation in which the immediate surface of the affected object is raised to a very high temperature while very little temperature rise occurs beneath its surface. This effect was called the flash burn effect by investigators after the war, who studied it closely as the angles of the burn, and the specific changes to the surfaces, could be used to precisely determine explosion parameters after the fact, like its exact altitude, height of burst, and size of fireball. Through Hiroshima (and Nagasaki), examples were found of surfaces that were scorched by this direct, line-of-sight heat radiation, which also had some intervening object that shielded part of the same surface from the heat. This created ""shadows"" in which, for example, the paint of a building might ignite, except in the areas in which it was shielded. In another example, a polished stoney material (like granite) became roughened in the areas exposed to the heat (which caused crystals within it to expand), while the shadowed areas remained polished."

Brother Inds;Business services & supplies;"Indian English (IndE, IE) is a group of English dialects spoken in the Republic of India and among the Indian diaspora and native to India. English is used by the Government of India for communication, and is enshrined in the Constitution of India. English is also an official language in seven states and seven union territories of India, and the additional official language in seven other states and one union territory. Furthermore, English is the sole official language of the Judiciary of India, unless the state governor or legislature mandates the use of a regional language, or if the President of India has given approval for the use of regional languages in courts.
Before the dissolution of the British Empire on the Indian subcontinent, the term Indian English broadly referred to South Asian English, also known as British Indian English.


== Status ==
After gaining independence from the British Raj in 1947, English remained an official language of the new Dominion of India and later the Republic of India. After the partition of India, Pakistani English and Bangladeshi English were considered separate from Indian English.
In the 21st century, only a few hundred thousand Indians, or less than 0.1% of the total population, speak English as their first language, and around 30% of the Indian population can speak English to some extent.
According to the 2001 Census, 12.18% of Indians knew English at that time. Of those, approximately 200,000 reported that it was their first language, 86 million reported that it was their second, and 39 million reported that it was their third."

FluMist was approved for children two years of age and older in 2007, but initially was approved only for healthy people ages 5 to 49, a significant limitation because it eliminated a significant market‚Äîyoung children who find injections objectionable. Sales of FluMist fell short of analysts' expectations for the first two years the drug was sold. FluMist was initially sold in a frozen form, which was difficult for doctors to store.
MedImmune conducted successful clinical trials for a new generation of FluMist needle-free vaccine, called CAIV-T, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2007, and is now the form offered on the market.

The term ""Orient"" derives from the Latin word oriens, meaning ""east"" (lit. ""rising"" < orior ""rise"").

Watson Pharma;Drugs & biotechnology;"Emergency contraception (EC) is a birth control measure, used after sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy.
There are different forms of EC. Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs), sometimes simply referred to as emergency contraceptives (ECs), or the morning-after pill, are medications intended to disrupt or delay ovulation or fertilization, which are necessary for pregnancy.
Intrauterine devices (IUDs) ‚Äì usually used as a primary contraceptive method ‚Äì are sometimes used as the most effective form of emergency contraception. However, the use of IUDs for emergency contraception is relatively rare.


== Definition ==
Emergency contraception is a birth control measure taken to reduce the risk of pregnancy following unprotected sexual intercourse or when other regular contraceptive measures have not worked properly or have not been used correctly. It is intended to be used occasionally and is not the same as medical abortion. Emergency contraception is offered to women who do not wish to conceive but have had unprotected sex on any day of the menstrual cycle, from day 21 after giving birth, or from day five after abortion or miscarriage. Emergency contraception measures include tablets taken by mouth or the insertion of a copper intrauterine device.
Emergency contraception is not related to medical abortion, which is a drug regimen administered to terminate pregnancies in any trimester.


== Emergency contraceptive pills ==
Emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) are sometimes referred to as emergency hormonal contraception (EHC)."

In Japan, voice actors (Â£∞ÂÑ™, seiy≈´) and actresses have devoted fan clubs due to a crossover with the idol industry, and some fans may watch a show merely to hear a particular voice actor. Many voice actors have concurrent singing careers and have also crossed over to live-action media.
There are around 130 voice acting schools in Japan. Broadcast companies and talent agencies often have their own troupes of vocal actors. Magazines focusing specifically on voice acting are published in Japan, with Voice Animage being the longest running.
The term character voice (abbreviated CV) has been commonly used since the 1980s by such Japanese anime magazines as Animec and Newtype to describe a voice actor associated with a particular anime or game character.

Imperial Holdings;Transportation;"The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates, and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It began with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England in the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and colonisation attempts by Scotland during the 17th century. At its height in the 19th and early 20th centuries, it became the largest empire in history and, for a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, 23 percent of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered 35.5 million km2 (13.7 million sq mi), 24 per cent of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its constitutional, legal, linguistic, and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, it was described as ""the empire on which the sun never sets"", as the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.
During the Age of Discovery in the 15th and 16th centuries, Portugal and Spain pioneered European exploration of the globe, and in the process established large overseas empires. Envious of the great wealth these empires generated, England, France, and the Netherlands began to establish colonies and trade networks of their own in the Americas and Asia. A series of wars in the 17th and 18th centuries with the Netherlands and France left Britain the dominant colonial power in North America. Britain became a major power in the Indian subcontinent after the East India Company's conquest of Mughal Bengal at the Battle of Plassey in 1757."

Before its failure, IndyMac Bank was the largest savings and loan association in the Los Angeles area and the seventh largest mortgage originator in the United States. The failure of IndyMac Bank on July 11, 2008, was the fourth largest bank failure in United States, and the second largest failure of a regulated thrift at that time.  ""Mac"" is an established contraction for ""Mortgage Corporation"", usually associated with government sponsored entities such as ""Freddie Mac"" (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) and ""Farmer Mac"" (Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation). Indymac, however, had always been a private corporation with no relationship to the government.
It was heavily involved in Alt-A mortgages and reverse mortgages which in part resulted in its dramatic rise and has been suggested as the cause for its demise, as a large number of these questionable loans failed during the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis of 2007‚Äì2009.
The FDIC put the assets up for auction and the bulk of the business was sold to IMB HoldCo LLC who turned this into OneWest Bank.  The FDIC kept some of the assets and liabilities that it could not sell in a holding entity known as IndyMac Federal Bank, which would be slowly wound down.

Loeb and Angelo Mozilo as a means of collateralizing Countrywide Financial loans too big to be sold to Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.

Hammerson;Diversified financials;"A  hammer is a tool, most often a hand tool, consisting of a weighted ""head"" fixed to a long handle that is swung to deliver an impact to a small area of an object. This can be, for example, to drive nails into wood, to shape metal (as with a forge), or to crush rock. Hammers are used for a wide range of driving, shaping, breaking and non-destructive striking applications. Traditional disciplines include carpentry, blacksmithing, warfare, and percussive musicianship (as with a gong).
Hammering is use of a hammer in its strike capacity, as opposed to prying with a secondary claw or grappling with a secondary hook. Carpentry and blacksmithing hammers are generally wielded from a stationary stance against a stationary target as gripped and propelled with one arm, in a lengthy downward planar arc‚Äîdownward to add kinetic energy to the impact‚Äîpivoting mainly around the shoulder and elbow, with a small but brisk wrist rotation shortly before impact; for extreme impact, concurrent motions of the torso and knee can lower the shoulder joint during the swing to further increase the length of the swing arc (but this is tiring). War hammers are often wielded in non-vertical planes of motion, with a far greater share of energy input provided from the legs and hips, which can also include a lunging motion, especially against moving targets. Small mallets can be swung from the wrists in a smaller motion permitting a much higher cadence of repeated strikes. Use of hammers and heavy mallets for demolition must adapt the hammer stroke to the location and orientation of the target, which can necessitate a clubbing or golfing motion with a two-handed grip.
The modern hammer head is typically made of steel which has been heat treated for hardness, and the handle (also known as a haft or helve) is typically made of wood or plastic."

BCV Group;Banking;"GLV and BCV are Australian television stations licensed to serve Traralgon, Bendigo and the region of Victoria. The stations are owned and operated by Network 10.


== History ==


=== Early years ===
GLV-10 in Traralgon was the first regional television station to launch in Australia on 9 December 1961, originally covering the Gippsland and Latrobe Valley areas. It was also the first station to completely use Australian-made broadcasting equipment from Amalgamated Wireless Australasia. The original transmission equipment consisted of a 10 kW and 2 kW transmitter (standby) which was based on the RCA product and adapted to 230 V 50 Hz by AWA. The Melbourne pickup was a Rhode and Schwarz off-air receiver with AWA return microwave links to the Studio. BCV-8 first went to air two weeks later, on 23 December 1961(the same day as the launch of GMV-6 Shepparton), serving Bendigo and Central Victoria.
On 25 March 1970, BCV-8 was off the air for 45 minutes. The incident was caused by two mice who got into the transmitter's high-voltage cables, short circuiting the main circuit and the switchboard.


=== Affiliations ===
GLV pioneered the use of live, ""off-air"" relays of television programs from stations in Melbourne, including GTV-9's hugely popular In Melbourne Tonight. Since the station had no video recording equipment, engineers needed to rely on picking up the original signal at the transmitter site to relay back to the studio."

Other style variants are provided in script typefaces and display typefaces. All these variants of the letter are encoded in Unicode as U+004C L LATIN CAPITAL LETTER L or U+006C l LATIN SMALL LETTER L, allowing presentation to be chosen according to each context. For specialist mathematical and scientific use, there are a number of dedicated codepoints in the Mathematical Alphanumeric Symbols block.
In the Romain du Roi, where the ascenders of lowercase letters have symmetrical serifs at the top, l has an extra serif to the left at the mean line to distinguish it from capital I.
Another means of reducing such confusion is to use symbol ‚Ñì, which is a cursive, handwriting-style lowercase form of the letter ""ell""."
PCCW;Telecommunications services;"In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is a correlation coefficient that measures linear correlation between two sets of data. It is the ratio between the covariance of two variables and the product of their standard deviations; thus, it is essentially a normalized measurement of the covariance, such that the result always has a value between ‚àí1 and 1."

With around 220,000 inhabitants, it is the second-largest city on the German Baltic coast and the second-largest city in the state of Schleswig-Holstein, after its capital of Kiel. It is the 36th-largest city in Germany.
The city lies in the Holsatian part of Schleswig-Holstein, on the mouth of the Trave, which flows into the Bay of L√ºbeck in the borough of Travem√ºnde, and on the Trave's tributary Wakenitz.

Saks;Retailing;"The Saka were a group of nomadic Eastern Iranian peoples who lived in the Eurasian Steppe and the Tarim Basin from the 9th century BC to the 5th century AD. The Saka were closely related to the Scythians, and both groups formed part of the wider Scythian cultures. However, they are distinguished from the Scythians by their specific geographical and cultural traits. The Saka languages formed part of the Scythian phylum, a branch of the Eastern Iranian languages.
Derived from the earlier Andronovo, Sintashta and Srubnaya cultures, the Saka were later influenced by the Bactria-Margiana Archaeological Culture and Iron Age East Asian genetic influx. The ancient Persians, ancient Greeks, and ancient Babylonians respectively used the names ""Saka,"" ""Scythian,"" and ""Cimmerian"" for all the steppe nomads. However, the name ""Saka"" is used specifically for the ancient nomads of the eastern steppe, while ""Scythian"" is used for the related group of nomads living in the western steppe.
Prominent archaeological remains of the Sakas include Arzhan, Tunnug, the Pazyryk burials, the Issyk kurgan, Saka Kurgan tombs, the Barrows of Tasmola and possibly Tillya Tepe. In the 2nd century BC, many Sakas were driven by the Yuezhi from the steppe into Sogdia and Bactria and then to the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, where they were known as the Indo-Scythians. Other Sakas invaded the Parthian Empire, eventually settling in Sistan, while others may have migrated to the Dian Kingdom in Yunnan, China. In the Tarim Basin and Taklamakan Desert of today's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, they settled in Khotan, Yarkand, Kashgar and other places."

Singapore Press;Media;"Singapore, officially the Republic of Singapore, is an island country and city-state in Southeast Asia. The country's territory comprises one main island, 63 satellite islands and islets, and one outlying islet. It is about one degree of latitude (137 kilometres or 85 miles) north of the equator, off the southern tip of the Malay Peninsula, bordering the Strait of Malacca to the west, the Singapore Strait to the south along with the Riau Islands in Indonesia, the South China Sea to the east, and the Straits of Johor along with the State of Johor in Malaysia to the north.
In its early history, Singapore was a maritime emporium known as Temasek and subsequently a major constituent part of several successive thalassocratic empires. Its contemporary era began in 1819, when Stamford Raffles established Singapore as an entrep√¥t trading post of the British Empire. In 1867, Singapore came under the direct control of Britain as part of the Straits Settlements. During World War II, Singapore was occupied by Japan in 1942 and returned to British control as a Crown colony following Japan's surrender in 1945. Singapore gained self-governance in 1959 and, in 1963, became part of the new federation of Malaysia, alongside Malaya, North Borneo, and Sarawak. Ideological differences led to Singapore's expulsion from the federation two years later; Singapore became an independent sovereign country in 1965. After early years of turbulence and despite lacking natural resources and a hinterland, the nation rapidly developed to become one of the Four Asian Tigers."

Largely responsible for solving India's currency problems and for the adoption of the Gold Standard, he was given a peerage by King George V for his services to industry in 1911. He chose the title ""Baron Inchcape, of Strathnaver in the County of Sutherland"", after the Inchcape Rock, which lies off Strathnaver and Arbroath (his birthplace) in Scotland, a prominent landmark that he had known well from sailing on voyages with his shipmaster father. Lord Inchcape was later created The 1st Viscount Inchcape in 1924, and was further advanced in the Peerage of the United Kingdom as The 1st Earl of Inchcape in 1929.

The total area of the city is 311.59 km2 (120.31 sq mi).  It was the most populous city within Gunma Prefecture until Takasaki merged with nearby towns between 2006 and 2009. Maebashi is known to be the ""City of Water, Greenery and Poets"" because of its pure waters, its rich nature and because it gave birth to several Japanese contemporary poets, such as Sakutar≈ç Hagiwara.


== Etymology ==
The Maebashi area was called Umayabashi (Âé©Ê©ã) during the Nara period. This name finds its origins in the fact that there was a bridge (hashi, Ê©ã) crossing the Tone River and not far from the bridge there was a small refreshment house with a stable (umaya, ÈßÖÂÆ∂), often used by people travelling on the T≈çzan-d≈ç (the road connecting the capital to the eastern regions of Japan). The spelling was officially changed into Maebashi (ÂâçÊ©ã) in 1649 during the Edo period when Maebashi became a castle town and the center of Maebashi Domain, a feudal domain under the Tokugawa shogunate.


== History ==
The town of Maebashi was established within Higashigunma District, Gunma Prefecture on April 1, 1889, with the creation of the modern municipalities system after the Meiji Restoration. Maebashi was raised to city status on April 1, 1892."

Network Appliance;Technology hardware & equipment;"A computer appliance is a computer system with a combination of hardware, software, or firmware that is specifically designed to provide a particular computing resource. Such devices became known as appliances because of the similarity in role or management to a home appliance, which are generally closed and sealed, and are not serviceable by the user or owner. The hardware and software are delivered as an integrated product and may even be pre-configured before delivery to a customer, to provide a turn-key solution for a particular application. Unlike general purpose computers, appliances are generally not designed to allow the customers to change the software and the underlying operating system, or to flexibly reconfigure the hardware.
Another form of appliance is the virtual appliance, which has similar functionality to a dedicated hardware appliance, but is distributed as a software virtual machine image for a hypervisor-equipped device.


== Overview ==
Traditionally, software applications run on top of a general-purpose operating system, which uses the hardware resources of the computer (primarily memory, disk storage, processing power, and networking bandwidth) to meet the computing needs of the user. The main issue with the traditional model is related to complexity. It is complex to integrate the operating system and applications with a hardware platform, and complex to support it afterwards.
By tightly constraining the variations of the hardware and software, the appliance becomes easily deployable, and can be used without nearly as wide (or deep) IT knowledge. Additionally, when problems and errors appear, the supporting staff very rarely needs to explore them deeply to understand the matter thoroughly."

Amer Power Conversion;Technology hardware & equipment;"Conversion to Islam, also known within Islam as reversion, is adopting Islam as a religion or faith. People who have converted to the religion often refer to themselves as ""reverts."" Conversion requires a formal statement of the shahƒÅdah, the credo of Islam, whereby the prospective convert must state that ""there is none worthy of worship in truth except Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."" Proselytism of the faith is referred to as ""dawah,"" and missionary efforts have been promoted since the dawn of the religion in the 7th century. Statistics relating to the amount of converts to Islam are scarce and often unreliable.


== Terminology ==
Converts to Islam may be referred to as ""converts,"" ""reverts,"" or ""new Muslims."" Many people who have converted to Islam prefer to call themselves ""reverts,"" in reference to a hadith that says that all people are Muslims at birth, but only come to ""leave"" the faith due to the environment they are raised in. The belief in the innate condition of Islam in all people is referred to as ""fitra.""


== Requirements ==
Converting to Islam requires one to declare the shahƒÅdah, the Muslim profession of faith (""there is none worthy of worship except Allah and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah"", Classical Arabic:     ÿ£Ÿéÿ¥ŸíŸáŸéÿØŸè ÿ£ŸéŸÜ ŸÑÿß ÿ•ŸêŸÑŸ∞ŸáŸé ÿ•ŸÑŸéŸëÿß ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá Ÿà ÿ£Ÿéÿ¥ŸíŸáŸéÿØŸè ÿ£ŸéŸÜŸé ŸÖŸèÿ≠ŸéŸÖŸéŸëÿØŸãÿß ÿ±Ÿéÿ≥ŸèŸàŸÑ ÿßŸÑŸÑŸá)

== Islamic missionary activities ==
Dawah (Arabic: ÿØÿπŸàÿ©, lit.‚Äâ'invitation', Arabic: [Ààd√¶ ïw√¶h]) is the act of inviting or calling people to embrace Islam. In Islamic theology, the purpose of da‚Äòwah is to invite people, Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the worship of God as expressed in the Qur'an and the sunnah of Muhammad and to inform them about Muhammad.
Dawah as the ""Call towards God"" is the means by which Muhammad began spreading the message of the Quran to mankind. After Muhammad, his followers and the Muslim community assumed responsibility for it."

Atos Origin;Business services & supplies;"Atoms are the basic particles of the chemical elements. An atom consists of a nucleus of protons and generally neutrons, surrounded by an electromagnetically bound swarm of electrons.  The chemical elements are distinguished from each other by the number of protons that are in their atoms. For example, any atom that contains 11 protons is sodium, and any atom that contains 29 protons is copper. Atoms with the same number of protons but a different number of neutrons are called isotopes of the same element.
Atoms are extremely small, typically around 100 picometers across. A human hair is about a million carbon atoms wide. Atoms are smaller than the shortest wavelength of visible light, which means humans cannot see atoms with conventional microscopes. They are so small that accurately predicting their behavior using classical physics is not possible due to quantum effects.
More than 99.9994% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus."

Sapporo Hokuyo;Banking;"Personal loans  in Japan are provided by three types of providers. First, there are large, traditional banks, with a long history. Their big advantage is the availability of loans and branches of these banks. Loans are also provided by specialized consumer credit companies. These are often owned by large, multi-national corporation. For example, Acom, one of leading consumer credit companies in Japan, is owned by Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group. The advantage of these loans is their availability when these companies are willing to serve customers who do not have a bank loan. A big role is played by psychology, when many people feel shame when they go to apply for a loan to the bank and often needs a guarantor.
On the Japanese market, there are companies that operate at so-called gray zone, sometimes called sarakin. According to estimations, about 10% of the population borrowed from them and there are about 10,000 companies like that on Japanese market."
Waters;Health care equipment & services;"Water is an inorganic compound with the chemical formula H2O. It is a transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance. It is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it acts as a solvent). It is vital for all known forms of life, despite not providing food energy or organic micronutrients. Its chemical formula, H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45¬∞. In liquid form, H2O is also called ""water"" at standard temperature and pressure.
Because Earth's environment is relatively close to water's triple point, water exists on Earth as a solid, a liquid, and a gas. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow."

Empire;Food markets;"An empire is a political unit made up of several territories, military outposts, and peoples, ""usually created by conquest, and divided between a dominant center and subordinate peripheries"". The center of the empire (sometimes referred to as the metropole) has political control over the peripheries. Within an empire, different populations may have different sets of rights and may be governed differently. The word ""empire"" derives from the Roman concept of imperium. Narrowly defined, an empire is a sovereign state whose head of state uses the title of ""emperor"" or  ""empress""; but not all states with aggregate territory under the rule of supreme authorities are called ""empires"" or are ruled by an emperor; nor have all self-described empires been accepted as such by contemporaries and historians (the Central African Empire of 1976 to 1979, and some Anglo-Saxon kingdoms in early England being examples).
There have been ""ancient and modern, centralized and decentralized, ultra-brutal and relatively benign"" empires. An important distinction has been between land empires made up solely of contiguous territories, such as the Austrian Empire, the First French Empire or the Russian Empire; and those - based on sea-power - which include territories that are remote from the 'home' country of the empire, such as the Spanish Empire, the French colonial Empire or the British Empire. 
Aside from the more formal usage, the concept of empire in popular thought is associated with such concepts as imperialism, colonialism, and globalization, with ""imperialism"" referring to the creation and maintenance of unequal relationships between nations and not necessarily the policy of a state headed by an emperor or empress. The word ""empire"" can also refer colloquially to a large-scale  business enterprise (e.g. a transnational corporation), to a political organization controlled by a single individual (a political boss) or by a group (political bosses)."

Bank;Banking;"The human back, also called the dorsum (pl.: dorsa), is the large posterior area of the human body, rising from the top of the buttocks to the back of the neck. It is the surface of the body opposite from the chest and the abdomen. The vertebral column runs the length of the back and creates a central area of recession. The breadth of the back is created by the shoulders at the top and the pelvis at the bottom.
Back pain is a common medical condition, generally benign in origin.

The central feature of the human back is the vertebral column, specifically the length from the top of the thoracic vertebrae to the bottom of the lumbar vertebrae, which houses the spinal cord in its spinal canal, and which generally has some curvature that gives shape to the back. The ribcage extends from the spine at the top of the back (with the top of the ribcage corresponding to the T1 vertebra), more than halfway down the length of the back, leaving an area with less protection between the bottom of the ribcage and the hips. The width of the back at the top is defined by the scapula, the broad, flat bones of the shoulders.

Puma;Household & personal products;"A pump is a device that moves fluids (liquids or gases), or sometimes slurries, by mechanical action, typically converted from electrical energy into hydraulic or pneumatic energy.
Mechanical pumps serve in a wide range of applications such as pumping water from wells, aquarium filtering, pond filtering and aeration, in the car industry for  water-cooling and fuel injection, in the energy industry for pumping oil and natural gas or for operating cooling towers and other components of heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems.  In the medical industry, pumps are used for biochemical processes in developing and manufacturing medicine, and as artificial replacements for body parts, in particular the artificial heart and penile prosthesis.
When a pump contains two or more pump mechanisms with fluid being directed to flow through them in series, it is called a multi-stage pump. Terms such as two-stage or double-stage may be used to specifically describe the number of stages. A pump that does not fit this description is simply a single-stage pump in contrast.
In biology, many different types of chemical and biomechanical pumps have evolved; biomimicry is sometimes used in developing new types of mechanical pumps.


== Types ==
Mechanical pumps may be submerged in the fluid they are pumping or be placed external to the fluid.
Pumps can be classified by their method of displacement into electromagnetic pumps, positive-displacement pumps, impulse pumps, velocity pumps, gravity pumps, steam pumps and valveless pumps.  There are three basic types of pumps: positive-displacement, centrifugal and axial-flow pumps."

Hays;Business services & supplies;"A hat is a head covering which is worn for various reasons, including protection against weather conditions, ceremonial reasons such as university graduation, religious reasons, safety, or as a fashion accessory. Hats which incorporate mechanical features, such as visors, spikes, flaps, braces or beer holders shade into the broader category of headgear.
In the past, hats were an indicator of social status. In the military, hats may denote nationality, branch of service, rank or regiment. Police typically wear distinctive hats such as peaked caps or brimmed hats, such as those worn by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Some hats have a protective function. As examples, the hard hat protects construction workers' heads from injury by falling objects, a British police Custodian helmet protects the officer's head, a sun hat shades the face and shoulders from the sun, a cowboy hat protects against sun and rain and an ushanka fur hat with fold-down earflaps keeps the head and ears warm. Some hats are worn for ceremonial purposes, such as the mortarboard, which is worn (or carried) during university graduation ceremonies. Some hats are worn by members of a certain profession, such as the Toque worn by chefs, or the mitre worn by Christian bishops. Adherents of certain religions regularly wear hats, such as the turban worn by Sikhs, or the church hat that is worn as a headcovering by Christian women during prayer and worship."

AMB Property;Diversified financials;"Prolog is a logic programming language that has its origins in artificial intelligence, automated theorem proving and computational linguistics.
Prolog has its roots in first-order logic, a formal logic, and unlike many other programming languages, Prolog is intended primarily as a declarative programming language: the program is a set of facts and rules, which define relations.  A computation is initiated by running a query over the program.
Prolog was one of the first logic programming languages and remains the most popular such language today, with several free and commercial implementations available. The language has been used for theorem proving, expert systems, term rewriting, type systems, and automated planning, as well as its original intended field of use, natural language processing.
Prolog is a Turing-complete, general-purpose programming language, which is well-suited for intelligent knowledge-processing applications.


== History ==

The name Prolog was chosen by Philippe Roussel, at the suggestion of his wife, as an abbreviation for Programmation en logique (French for Programming in logic). It was created around 1972 by Alain Colmerauer with Philippe Roussel, from the Artificial Intelligence Group of the Faculty of Sciences of Luminy of Aix-Marseille II University of France. It was based on Robert Kowalski's procedural interpretation of Horn clauses, and it was motivated in part by the desire to reconcile the use of logic as a declarative knowledge representation language with the procedural representation of knowledge that was popular in North America in the late 1960s and early 1970s. According to Robert Kowalski, the first Prolog system was developed in 1972 by Colmerauer and Phillipe Roussel."

On April 30, 2010, Westernbank, its wholly owned bank subsidiary, failed and its deposits and assets were seized by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and subsequently sold to Banco Popular de Puerto Rico.


== History ==
Westernbank was founded on March 1, 1958, under the name Western Federal Savings and Loan Association of Puerto Rico in the western town of Mayag√ºez by Miguel A. Garc√≠a M√©ndez, a local statesman, businessman and experienced banker. With initial deposits reaching $250,000, the bank grew at a rapid rate, quadrupling its deposits and assets in less than nine months. By the early 1960s, Westernbank had expanded to the western and southwestern region of the island, with bank branches in the towns of Aguadilla, San Germ√°n and Cabo Rojo.
Between 1978 and 1981, when the United States and Puerto Rican economies were suffering from high inflation rates, local banks were facing losses due to an increasing number in bankruptcies and unemployment rates, and some were forced to either close, merge, or sell portions of their assets. To counter these economic conditions, Westernbank applied conservative policies and banking practices that included tightening its credit lending criteria, assuming stricter loan to value ratios, favoring collateralized loans, and restructuring its assets and liabilities. In 1988, facing an impending recession in the US and Puerto Rico, Westernbank began applying the same conservative measures, to reduce inherent risks and protect the bank's capital position. During the following years, between 1989 and 1990, private and public savings banks on the island, with the exception of Westernbank, faced losses, restated their financial statements, and saw significant decreases in their stock prices.
Westernbank lending policies and practices focused mainly on mortgage residential loans rather than commercial and construction loans because, although commercial and construction loans offer a much higher rate of return, mortgage loans offer a much smaller risk of default."

Bilfinger & Berger;Construction;"Bilfinger SE (previously named Bilfinger Berger AG) is a German multinational company specialized in civil and industrial construction, engineering and services based in Mannheim, Germany.


== History ==

Bilfinger dates back to 1880 when August Bernatz founded Bernatz Ingenieurwissenschaft as an engineering business: it became known, from 1886 as Bernatz & Gr√ºn and, from 1892, as Gr√ºn & Bilfinger when Paul Bilfinger replaced Bernatz as partner.
During the Second World War, Gr√ºn & Bilfinger employed Jewish slave laborers from the Kovno Ghetto in occupied Lithuania where it was known for its brutal harassment of the Jewish slaves.
In 1970, Gr√ºn & Bilfinger acquired a majority stake in Julius Berger-Bauboag AG, itself a merger of two companies, Julius Berger Tiefbau AG and Berlinische Boden-Gesellschaft AG, both founded in 1890. The combined business, fully integrated in 1975, finally took the name Bilfinger & Berger Bauaktiengesellschaft. In 1994 the acquisition of Razel Company took place.
In 2001 the business changed its name to Bilfinger Berger AG.
In 2005, Bilfinger bought all shares of Babcock Borsig Service Group from Deutsche Beteiligungs AG.
In 2008 the company sold Razel to group Fayat for 137 million euro.
In October 2009 the company acquired directly MCE Beteiligungsverwaltungs GmbH itself, a business based in Linz focused on the design, construction and maintenance of facilities in the process industry and the energy sector.
In June 2010, a prospectus was issued with the aim of listing Bilfinger Berger Australia on the Australian Securities Exchange via an initial public offering. In July 2010 the listing was abandoned with a trade sale to Lendlease agreed in December 2010."
Investors Financial;Diversified financials;"An investor is a person who allocates financial capital with the expectation of a future return (profit) or to gain an advantage (interest). Through this allocated capital the investor usually purchases some species of property. Types of investments include equity, debt, securities, real estate, infrastructure, currency, commodity, token, derivatives such as put and call options, futures, forwards, etc. This definition makes no distinction between the investors in the primary and secondary markets.  That is, someone who provides a business with capital and someone who buys a stock are both investors.  An investor who owns stock is a shareholder.


== Types of investors ==
There are two types of investors: retail investors and institutional investors.
A retail investor is also known as an individual investor.
There are several sub-types of institutional investor:

Pension plans making investments on behalf of employees
Businesses that make investments, either directly or via a captive fund
Endowment funds used by universities, churches, etc.
Mutual funds, hedge funds, and other funds, ownership of which may or may not be publicly traded (these funds typically pool money raised from their owner-subscribers to invest in securities)
Sovereign wealth funds
Large money managers
Investors might also be classified according to their profiles."

Danisco;Food drink & tobacco;"Danisco A/S is a Danish bio-based company with activities in food production, enzymes and other bioproducts as well as a wide variety of pharmaceutical grade excipients. It was formed in 1989 from the largest Danish industrial merger ever of the two old C.F. Tietgen companies Danish Sugar (founded 1872), and Dansk Handels- og Industri Company (Danisco A/S).
Danisco is one of the world's leading producers of ingredients for food and other consumer products and was also one of the biggest sugar producers in Europe until the divestment of its sugar division to Nordzucker in 2009.
Headquartered in Copenhagen, the group has approximately 6,800 employees in more than 80 locations in 40 countries.
Danisco shares were listed on the Copenhagen Stock Exchange and a member of the blue chip OMX Copenhagen 20 index until June 2011, when DuPont completed a US$6.3 billion acquisition of the company. On February 1, 2021, DuPont's Nutrition & Biociences business unit, which includes Danisco, spun off from DuPont an merged with IFF through a Reverse Morris Trust transaction.


== Activities ==
The company's activities were structured into two lines of business: Food Ingredients and Industrial enzymes. The Food Ingredients business supplied bio-based ingredients for food and beverage products and comprises the business segments Enablers, Cultures, and Sweeteners, while the Industrial Enzymes business (handled by subsidiary Genencor) focuses on industrial biotechnology and encompasses business segments such as Fabric and Household Care (enzymes for laundry and dishwashing detergents), Technical Enzymes (enzymes for bioethanol and carbohydrate processing as well as textile treatment), and Food and Animal Nutrition (enzymes for bread, feed, and brewing applications).

On 9 January 2011, DuPont announced that it had reached agreement to buy Danisco for US$6.3 billion."
Japan Securities Fin;Diversified financials;"A security token offering (STO) / tokenized IPO is a type of public offering in which tokenized digital securities, known as security tokens, are sold in security token exchanges. Tokens can be used to trade real financial assets such as equities and fixed income, and use a blockchain virtual ledger system to store and validate token transactions.
Due to tokens being classified as securities, STOs are more susceptible to regulation and thus represent a more secure investment alternative than ICOs, which have been subject to numerous fraudulent schemes.
Furthermore, since ICOs are not held in traditional exchanges, they can be a less expensive funding source for small and medium-sized companies when compared to an IPO. An STO on a regulated stock exchange (referred to as a tokenized IPO) has the potential to deliver significant efficiencies and cost savings, however.
By the end of 2019, STOs had been used in multiple scenarios including the trading of Nasdaq-listed company stocks, the pre-IPO of World Chess, FIDE's official broadcasting platform, and the creation of Singapore Exchange's own STO market, backed by Japan's Tokai Tokyo Financial Holdings.


== Controversy regarding ICOs ==
Though sharing some core concepts with ICOs and IPOs, STOs are in fact different from both, standing as an intermediary model. Similarly to ICOs, STOs are offerings that are made by selling digital tokens to the general public in cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Kraken, Binaryx and others. The main difference stands in the fact that ICO tokens are the offered cryptocurrency's actual coins, entirely digital, and classified as utilities. New ICO currencies can be generated ad infinitum, as might in some cases their tokens. Additionally, their value is almost entirely speculative and arises from the perceived utility value buyers expect them to provide."

Pogo Producing;Oil & gas operations;"A pogo stick is a vehicle for jumping off the ground in a standing position‚Äîthrough the aid of a spring, or new high performance technologies‚Äîoften used as a toy, exercise equipment or extreme sports instrument. It led to an extreme sport named extreme pogo or ""Xpogo"".
It consists of a pole with a handle at the top and footrests near the bottom, and a spring located somewhere along the pole. The spring joins two sections of the pole, which extends below the footpads.
The jumper places their feet on the footpads while balancing on the pole, then jumps up or down with a bending action of the knees to add or subtract energy in the spring. When the spring is at full compression or extension, the jumper is lifted by the recoil of the spring, being launched several inches or feet into the air. This process is repeated to maintain a periodic bounce.
The pogo stick can be steered by shifting one's weight off the centerline of the spring in the desired horizontal direction thus producing horizontal locomotion.


== Inventors ==
A spring stilt utilizing compression springs on each foot was patented in 1881 by George H. Herrington of Wichita, Kansas, ""for leaping great distances and heights"". This was an antecedent of the pogo stick as well as today's spring stilts."

MDU Resources got its start in 1924 as the Minnesota Northern Power Company. Its founder, Rolland Heskett, had previously been involved with utilities in Wisconsin and northeast Minnesota (the forerunners of Wisconsin Public Service Corporation and Minnesota Power (& Light Co.), respectively). The firm's  holdings initially consisted of the electric utility at Cushing, Oklahoma (later sold off to Oklahoma Gas & Electric), Minnesota Electric Light & Power Company, which served the Bemidji, Minnesota area (sold in 1925 to the W.B. Foshay interests ‚Äî this property today comprises Otter Tail Power's Bemidji division), the Eastern Montana Light & Power Company, centered around Sidney and Glendive, Montana, and the Eastern Montana Utilities Co., which was based in Fairview, Montana. The two 'Eastern Montana' utilities became the nucleus of Montana-Dakota Utilities' operations.
Initially, Minnesota Northern was only in the business of selling electric power, but entered the natural gas business following its discovery of oil in 1936 in the Williston Basin in Eastern Montana. As it expanded across Eastern Montana and western North Dakota, it acquired the electric franchise for Miles City, Montana, after an acquisition struggle with the Montana Power Company.
Shortly after passage of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (PUHCA), Heskett reorganized all the gas and electric subsidiaries of Minnesota Northern Power under a new name ‚Äî Montana-Dakota Utilities."

Emporiki Bank in Greece was nationalized in 1975, and eventually purchased on 1 February 2013 by Alpha Bank which absorbed it into its network.


== History ==
The Commercial Bank of Greece (CBG) was established in London by the Greek banker Gregorios Empedocles (Greek: ŒìœÅŒ∑Œ≥œåœÅŒπŒøœÇ ŒïŒºœÄŒµŒ¥ŒøŒ∫ŒªŒÆœÇ) in 1907 and two years later listed on the stock exchange. In 1922, CBG established Commercial Bank of the Near East (CBNE) in London with CBG as a major shareholder and with the banker Nicolas Christofides as chief manager. The latter expanded CBG's international operations further by opening a first branch of the Commercial Bank of the Near East in Constantinople in 1922, a second one in Alexandria in 1925, and subsequently another in Cairo. Nicolas Christofides, who settled in Alexandria in the 1920s-30s, managed the Turkish and Egyptian branches of the CBNE until the 1960s.
After the Suez Crisis in 1956, Egypt nationalized the operations of British and French banks. To avoid nationalization, in 1957, N. Christofides convinced the Egyptian authorities that the Commercial Bank of the Near East, despite its official British nationality, was unofficially Greek, arguing that all shareholders and clients were Greek. Thus, CBNE, which was incorporated in London, transferred its branches in Egypt to Commercial Bank of Greece."

They usually have their head office in the capital city of one of the 47 prefectures of Japan, serving mainly its local prefectural customers. Historically, regional banks in the same areas tend to merge over time, reducing overheads while increasing their strength and regional footprint.


== Details ==
As of January 2025, there are 61 main regional banks. There is also a category known as ""regional banks II"", numbering 39 additional institutions (down from 68 in 1990), most of whom ""have converted from mutual savings banks to ordinary commercial banks"".
The regional bank is in contrast to a city bank (toshi gink≈ç ÈÉΩÂ∏ÇÈäÄË°å or togin ÈÉΩÈäÄ) or ""megabank"" with its head office in metropolitan Tokyo, Nagoya, or Osaka.

== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Stomp was born on 30 September 1999 in Amstelveen, Netherlands. When he was 6, he started playing the violin. By the age of 11, he began playing the drums and shortly thereafter became interested in making music. He also developed an interest in deep house and future house when he heard ""Gecko"" by Oliver Heldens and taught himself how to do it by learning it from YouTube. At the age of 14, he became inspired when he 'touched' a DJ set for the first time, prompting him to download specialist software, FL Studio, and enabling him to start composing. He started making deep house music at that same age, but moved to slightly harder house, as well as future house. He studied at Herman Brood Academy, a production school in Utrecht where Martin Garrix and Julian Jordan also went to.

Molex;Technology hardware & equipment;"Moloch, Molech, or Molek is a word which appears in the Hebrew Bible several times, primarily in the Book of Leviticus.  The Greek Septuagint translates many of these instances as ""their king"", but maintains the word or name Moloch in others, including one additional time in the Book of Amos where the Hebrew text does not attest the name. The Bible strongly condemns practices that are associated with Moloch, which are heavily implied to include child sacrifice.
Traditionally, the name Moloch has been understood as referring to a Canaanite god. However, since 1935, scholars have speculated that Moloch refers to the sacrifice itself, since the Hebrew word mlk is identical in spelling to a term that means ""sacrifice"" in the closely related Punic language. This second position has grown increasingly popular, but it remains contested. Among proponents of this second position, controversy continues as to whether the sacrifices were offered to Yahweh or another deity, and whether they were a native Israelite religious custom or a Phoenician import.
Since the medieval period, Moloch has often been portrayed as a bull-headed idol with outstretched hands over a fire; this depiction takes the brief mentions of Moloch in the Bible and combines them with various sources, including ancient accounts of Carthaginian child sacrifice and the legend of the Minotaur.
Beginning in the modern era, ""Moloch"" has been figuratively used in reference to a power which demands a dire sacrifice. A god Moloch appears in various works of literature and film, such as John Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), Gustave Flaubert's Salammb√¥ (1862), Gabriele D'Annunzio's Cabiria (1914), Fritz Lang's Metropolis (1927), and Allen Ginsberg's ""Howl"" (1955)."

The Sumitomo Group traces its roots to a bookshop in Kyoto founded circa 1615 by Masatomo Sumitomo, a former Buddhist monk. Even today, management of the group is guided by his ""Founder's Precepts"", written in the 17th century.

In 1590, he established a smelting business, Izumiya, literally meaning ""spring shop"". Riemon perfected techniques that allowed the extraction of silver from copper ore, something Japanese technology had not previously accomplished.
The smelting and smithing business was moved from Kyoto to Osaka by the late 17th century. Soga passed control of the company to his son Tomomochi who managed its transformation into a major trading house during the Edo period."

Storage Technology;Technology hardware & equipment;"Computer data storage or digital data storage is a technology consisting of computer components and recording media that are used to retain digital data. It is a core function and fundamental component of computers.:‚Ää15‚Äì16‚Ää
The central processing unit (CPU) of a computer is what manipulates data by performing computations. In practice, almost all computers use a storage hierarchy,:‚Ää468‚Äì473‚Ää which puts fast but expensive and small storage options close to the CPU and slower but less expensive and larger options further away. Generally, the fast technologies are referred to as ""memory"", while slower persistent technologies are referred to as ""storage"".
Even the first computer designs, Charles Babbage's Analytical Engine and Percy Ludgate's Analytical Machine, clearly distinguished between processing and memory (Babbage stored numbers as rotations of gears, while Ludgate stored numbers as displacements of rods in shuttles). This distinction was extended in the Von Neumann architecture, where the CPU consists of two main parts: The control unit and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). The former controls the flow of data between the CPU and memory, while the latter performs arithmetic and logical operations on data.


== Functionality ==
Without a significant amount of memory, a computer would merely be able to perform fixed operations and immediately output the result. It would have to be reconfigured to change its behavior. This is acceptable for devices such as desk calculators, digital signal processors, and other specialized devices."

In 1898, a new public company was formed and the two businesses were sold to the new company, named Fraser & Neave (F&N), for $290,000 in cash and shares.


=== Diversification, restructuring, and expansion ===
In 1931, Fraser & Neave formed a joint venture with Holland's Heineken to venture into the brewing business. The brewery, Malayan Breweries Limited produced Tiger Beer, and later acquired Archipelago Brewery, which produced Anchor Beer.
In 1936, F&N acquired the Singapore, Malaya and Brunei franchise rights for Coca-Cola drinks."

Genting;Hotels restaurants & leisure;"Genting Highlands is a hill station located on the peak of Mount Ulu Kali in the Titiwangsa Mountains, central  Peninsular Malaysia, at 1800 metres elevation. Located in the state of Pahang, it was established in 1965 by the late Malaysian businessman Lim Goh Tong. The primary tourist attraction is Resorts World Genting, a hill resort where casinos and theme parks are situated and where gambling is permitted. Many of Pahang's skyscrapers can be found here.


== History ==

The idea to build a hill resort near the capital city of Kuala Lumpur came from Malaysian businessman, Lim Goh Tong who was inspired by the fresh air in Cameron Highlands during his business trip there in 1963 for a hydroelectric power project. The rationale was that Cameron Highlands was too far away from Kuala Lumpur, and therefore building a mountain resort nearer to Kuala Lumpur would have excellent business potential. After researching Kuala Lumpur's maps and surrounding areas, Lim identified Mount Ulu Kali in Genting Sempah, 58 km from Kuala Lumpur, to be ideal for his plan. He set up a private company called Genting Highlands Berhad (now Genting Group) on 27 April 1965 with the politician Mohamad Noah Omar and successfully obtained approval for the alienation of 12,000 acres (4,900 ha) and 2,800 acres (1,100 ha) of land from the Pahang and Selangor State Government respectively between 1965 and 1970.
On 18 August 1965, a technical and construction team began to construct the access road from Genting Sempah to the peak of Mount Ulu Kali. On 31 March 1969, Tunku Abdul Rahman, Malaysia's first prime minister, laid the foundation stone for the company's pioneer hotel, marking the completion of the access road to Genting Highlands Resort."

People`s Bank;Banking;"The People's Bank of China (officially PBC and unofficially PBOC) is the central bank of the People's Republic of China. It is responsible for carrying out monetary policy as determined by the PRC People's Bank Law and the PRC Commercial Bank Law.
The PBC was established in 1948 as the bank serving areas of mainland China under Chinese Communist Party (CCP) control and became China's sole central bank after the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949. From 1969 to 1978, the PBC was demoted to a bureau of the Ministry of Finance. The PBC was extensively reformed during the 1990s, when its provincial and local branches were abolished, instead opening nine regional branches. In 2023, these reforms were reversed as when the regional branches were abolished and the provincial branches restored, and new arrangements essentially ended the PBC's longstanding role in financial supervision.
The PBC is the 25th-ranked of 26 ministerial-level departments of the State Council. The PBC lacks central bank independence and is required to implement the policies of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) under the direction of the party's Central Financial Commission. The PBC is led by a governor assisted by several deputy governors and a CCP Committee Secretary. Since 2023, the roles of governor and CCP Committee Secretary have been held jointly by Pan Gongsheng."

Allergan;Drugs & biotechnology;"An allergen is an otherwise harmless substance that triggers an allergic reaction in sensitive individuals by stimulating an immune response.
In technical terms, an allergen is an antigen that is capable of stimulating a type-I hypersensitivity reaction in atopic individuals through immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses. Most humans mount significant Immunoglobulin E responses only as a defense against parasitic infections. However, some individuals may respond to many common environmental antigens. This hereditary predisposition is called atopy. In atopic individuals, non-parasitic antigens stimulate inappropriate IgE production, leading to type I hypersensitivity.
Sensitivities vary widely from one person (or from one animal) to another. A very broad range of substances can be allergens to sensitive individuals.


== Examples ==

Allergens can be found in a variety of sources, such as dust mite excretion, pollen, pet dander, or even royal jelly. Food allergies are not as common as food sensitivity, but some foods such as peanuts (a legume), nuts, seafood and shellfish are the cause of serious allergies in many people."

In 1947, under the direction of 'Pat' Winfrey, the family's newspaper titles were consolidated to form the East Midland Allied Press (EMAP): this was achieved by the merger of the Northamptonshire Printing and Publishing Company, the Peterborough Advertiser Company, the West Norfolk and King's Lynn Newspaper Company and commercial printing sections at Rushden, King's Lynn and Bury St Edmunds.
The magazine division was founded on a hunch when the company's printing presses lay dormant between printing issues of the local papers. The staff gambled that a weekly angling publication would be a hit; in 1953, Angling Times was born.

The city is built along the shores of Hakata Bay, and has been a center of international commerce since ancient times. The area has long been considered the gateway to the country, as it is the nearest point among Japan's main islands to the Asian mainland. Although humans occupied the area since the Jomon period, some of the earliest settlers of the Yayoi period arrived in the Fukuoka area. The city rose to prominence during the Yamato period. Because of the cross-cultural exposure, and the relatively great distance from the social and political centers of Kyoto, Osaka, and later, Edo (Tokyo), Fukuoka gained a distinctive local culture and dialect that has persisted to the present.
Fukuoka is the most populous city on Ky≈´sh≈´ island, followed by Kitakyushu. It is the largest city and metropolitan area west of Keihanshin.

It is also a separate regional unit of the Ionian Islands region. It was a former Latin Catholic diocese Kefalonia‚ÄìZakynthos (Cefalonia‚ÄìZante) and short-lived titular see as just Kefalonia. The capital city of Cephalonia is Argostoli.


== History ==


=== Antiquity ===


==== Legend ====

An aition explaining the name of Cephallenia and reinforcing its cultural connections with Athens associates the island with the mythological figure of Cephalus, who helped Amphitryon of Mycenae in a war against the Taphians and Teleboans. He was rewarded with the island of Same, which thereafter came to be known as Cephallenia.
Kefalonia has also been suggested as the Homeric Ithaca, the home of Odysseus, rather than the smaller island bearing this name today. Robert Bittlestone, in his book Odysseus Unbound, has suggested that Paliki, now a peninsula of Cephalonia, was a separate island during the late Bronze Age, and it may be this which Homer was referring to when he described Ithaca. A project which started in the summer of 2007 and lasted three years has examined this possibility.
Kefalonia is also referenced in relation to the goddess Britomartis, as the location where she is said to have 'received divine honours from the inhabitants under the name of Laphria'."

Dassault Systemes;Software & services;"Dassault Syst√®mes SE (French pronunciation: [daso sist…õm]) (abbreviated 3DS) is a French multinational software corporation which develops software for 3D product design, simulation, manufacturing and other 3D related products.
Founded in 1981, it is headquartered in V√©lizy-Villacoublay, France, and has 23,811 employees across 194 global offices.


== History ==


=== 1980s ===
Dassault Syst√®mes (also known as 3DS) grew out of the aerospace industry's search for more sophisticated drafting tools to streamline the development process and aid in the increasing complexity of aviation design. Dassault Syst√®mes spun out in 1981 (as part of Dassault Group) to develop and market their 3D surface design software CATI, later renamed CATIA. That same year, Dassault Syst√®mes signed a sales and marketing agreement with IBM, allowing IBM to resell the CATIA CAD software.


=== 1990s ===
In the 1990s, Dassault Syst√®mes' software was used to develop seven out of every ten new airplanes and four out of every ten new cars worldwide. Major players in the aviation and automotive industries, including Honda, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Boeing, were able to design and mock-up their products in CATIA rather than using CAD programs and physical prototypes. The Boeing 777, the Falcon 2000 business jet, and the Rafale jet fighter were designed using CATIA.
Dassault Syst√®mes launched an initial public offering (IPO) on both the Paris Bourse and Nasdaq in 1996. Following its success, the next year, the company acquired SolidWorks and Deneb Robotics, which later became part of the DELMIA brand, and additional software to build toward product lifecycle management (PLM). The SolidWorks acquisition strengthened Dassault Syst√®mes' 2D drafting capacity and provided entry into the Microsoft market, while other acquisitions added digital manufacturing software to the product lineup. These acquisitions paved the way for Dassault Syst√®mes to introduce a total manufacturing system with their subsidiary brand, DELMIA, in 1998."
Dow Jones;Media;"The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), Dow Jones, or simply the Dow (), is a stock market index of 30 prominent companies listed on stock exchanges in the United States.
The DJIA is one of the oldest and most commonly followed equity indices. It is price-weighted, unlike other common indexes such as the Nasdaq Composite or S&P 500, which use market capitalization. The DJIA also contains fewer stocks, which could exhibit higher risk; however, it could be less volatile when the market is rapidly rising or falling due to its components being well-established large-cap companies.
The value of the index can also be calculated as the sum of the stock prices of the companies included in the index, divided by a factor, which is approximately 0.163 as of November 2024. The factor is changed whenever a constituent company undergoes a stock split so that the value of the index is unaffected by the stock split.
First calculated on May 26, 1896, the index is the second-oldest among U.S. market indices, after the Dow Jones Transportation Average. It was created by Charles Dow, co-founder of both The Wall Street Journal and Dow Jones & Company, and named after him and his business associate, statistician Edward Jones.
The index is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices, an entity majority-owned by S&P Global. Its components are selected by a committee."

Kiyo Bank;Banking;"A regional bank (chih≈ç gink≈ç Âú∞ÊñπÈäÄË°å or chigin Âú∞ÈäÄ) is a Japanese term for one of the 100 banks who are members of the Regional Banks Association of Japan (zenkoku chih≈çgink≈ç ky≈çkai ÂÖ®ÂõΩÂú∞ÊñπÈäÄË°åÂçî‰ºö). They usually have their head office in the capital city of one of the 47 prefectures of Japan, serving mainly its local prefectural customers. Historically, regional banks in the same areas tend to merge over time, reducing overheads while increasing their strength and regional footprint.

The Sumitomo Group traces its roots to a bookshop in Kyoto founded circa 1615 by Masatomo Sumitomo, a former Buddhist monk. Even today, management of the group is guided by his ""Founder's Precepts"", written in the 17th century.
Copper refining made the company famous. Riemon Soga, Masatomo Sumitomo's brother-in-law, learned Western methods of copper refining. In 1590, he established a smelting business, Izumiya, literally meaning ""spring shop"". Riemon perfected techniques that allowed the extraction of silver from copper ore, something Japanese technology had not previously accomplished.
The smelting and smithing business was moved from Kyoto to Osaka by the late 17th century. Soga passed control of the company to his son Tomomochi who managed its transformation into a major trading house during the Edo period."

Pentair;Conglomerates;"Pentair plc (PNR) is an American water treatment company incorporated in Ireland with tax residency in UK, with its main U.S. office in Golden Valley, Minnesota. Pentair was founded in the US, with 65% of company's revenue coming from the US and Canada as of 2017. PNR was reorganized in 2014, shifting the corporate domicile from Switzerland to Ireland.
On April 30, 2018, PNR announced that it had completed the separation of its Water and Electrical businesses. Now the company's primary focus is on residential, commercial, industrial, municipal and infrastructure and agriculture applications. Its fiscal year 2021 revenues were US$3.8 billion and it employs approximately 11,250 people worldwide.


== History ==


=== 1960s ===
Pentair was founded in August 1966 as Pentair Industries, Inc., with the name derived from the Greek root word ""penta-"" (alluding to the company's five founders) and ""air"" (alluding to the company's original product), and went public several months later. The 5 founders were all formally employed by Litton Industries. Originally, they intended to manufacture high altitude research balloons, but they found sales to be less than expected. They acquired a local vacuum-forming business shortly thereafter and set about making canoes."

Momiji Holdings;Banking;"Momiji (Á¥ÖËëâ, ""Maple Leaves"") is a prominent kijo (female demon) in Japanese folklore. Her story, known as the Legend of Momiji (Á¥ÖËëâ‰ºùË™¨, Momiji Densetsu), is primarily associated with the regions of Kinasa, Togakushi (both now part of Nagano City), and Bessho Onsen in Nagano Prefecture. The central narrative involves the hero Taira no Koremochi battling and ultimately defeating the kijo named Momiji, who resided on Mount Togakushi.


== Origins and Development ==

The common element across most versions is a female demon named Momiji dwelling on Mount Togakushi in Shinano Province, who is eventually slain by the warrior Taira no Koremochi.
The legend gained significant prominence through adaptations in traditional performing arts. The Noh play Momijigari (Maple Viewing), likely composed by Kanze Nobumitsu in the latter half of the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573), is a cornerstone. This play depicts Koremochi encountering a group of noblewomen enjoying autumn maple viewing on Mount Togakushi, only to discover their leader is the disguised demon Momiji. While it's widely believed the Noh play drew upon pre-existing local legends of demons on Mount Togakushi, some scholars consider the specific narrative featuring Momiji as possibly originating with Nobumitsu. Numerous legendary sites related to Momiji around Togakushi are thought to have been established *after* the popularization of the story through Noh and other media.
Following the Noh play, the story was adapted into J≈çruri puppet theatre and Kabuki."

Shanghai Automotive;Consumer durables;"SAIC Motor Corp., Ltd. (formerly Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation) is a Chinese state-owned automobile manufacturer headquartered in Anting, Shanghai. Founded in 1955, it is currently the largest of the ""Big Four"" state-owned car manufacturers of China ahead of FAW Group, Dongfeng Motor Corporation, and Changan Automobile, with sales of 5.02 million vehicles in 2023.
The company traces its origins to the early years of the Chinese automobile industry in the 1940s, and SAIC was one of the few carmakers in Mao's China, making the Shanghai SH760. Currently, it participates in the oldest surviving sino-foreign automotive joint venture with Volkswagen (SAIC-Volkswagen) since 1984, and in addition operates a joint venture with General Motors (SAIC-GM) since 1998. It also produces and sells passenger vehicles under its own branding, such as Roewe, MG, Maxus/LDV, Rising Auto, and IM Motors. It is also the largest shareholder of SAIC-GM-Wuling (SGMW), a joint venture selling Wuling and Baojun branded vehicles. In 2021, SAIC self-owned brands contributes 52% of SAIC's sales.
The company ranked 84th on the Fortune Global 500 list in 2023. Including SGMW, it was also the third-largest plug-in electric vehicle (battery electric and plug-in hybrid) company and second-largest battery electric vehicle manufacturer in the world, with 10.5% and 13% global market share respectively in 2021."
Bank of Nagoya;Banking;"Nagoya (ÂêçÂè§Â±ãÂ∏Ç, Nagoya-shi, [naÍúú.…°o.ja, na.…°o.jaÍúú.…ïi, -≈ão-] ) is the largest city in the Ch≈´bu region of Japan. It is the fourth-most populous city in Japan, with a population of 2.3 million in 2020, and the principal city of the Ch≈´ky≈ç metropolitan area, which is the third-most populous metropolitan area in Japan with a population of 10.11 million. Located on the Pacific coast in central Honshu, it is the capital and most populous city of Aichi Prefecture, with the Port of Nagoya being Japan's largest seaport.
In 1610, the warlord Tokugawa Ieyasu, a retainer of Oda Nobunaga, moved the capital of Owari Province from Kiyosu to Nagoya. This period saw the renovation of Nagoya Castle. The arrival of the 20th century brought a convergence of economic factors that fueled rapid growth in Nagoya during the Meiji Restoration, and it became a major industrial hub for Japan. The traditional manufactures of timepieces, bicycles, and sewing machines were followed by the production of special steels, ceramic, chemicals, oil, and petrochemicals, as the area's automobile, aviation, and shipbuilding industries flourished. These factors made the city a target for air raids during the Pacific War.

They usually have their head office in the capital city of one of the 47 prefectures of Japan, serving mainly its local prefectural customers. Historically, regional banks in the same areas tend to merge over time, reducing overheads while increasing their strength and regional footprint.


== Details ==

The regional bank is in contrast to a city bank (toshi gink≈ç ÈÉΩÂ∏ÇÈäÄË°å or togin ÈÉΩÈäÄ) or ""megabank"" with its head office in metropolitan Tokyo, Nagoya, or Osaka. Each of these banks have a large footprint and a wide network of branches in the larger cities of Japan.

By 1985 overseas earnings amounted to 46% of Kumagai's total contracts."

AWG;Utilities;"American Wire Gauge (AWG) is a logarithmic stepped standardized wire gauge system used since 1857, predominantly in North America, for the diameters of round, solid, nonferrous, electrically conducting wire. Dimensions of the wires are given in ASTM standard B 258. The cross-sectional area of each gauge is an important factor for determining its current-carrying capacity.


== Origin ==
The AWG originated in the number of drawing operations used to produce a given gauge of wire. Very fine wire (for example, 30 gauge) required more passes through the drawing dies than 0 gauge wire did. Manufacturers of wire formerly had proprietary wire gauge systems; the development of standardized wire gauges rationalized selection of wire for a particular purpose.
While the AWG is essentially identical to the Brown & Sharpe (B&S) sheet metal gauge, the B&S gauge was designed for use with sheet metals. These are functionally interchangeable but the use of B&S in relation to wire gauges, rather than sheet metal gauges, is technically improper.


== Specifications ==
Increasing gauge numbers denote logarithmically decreasing wire diameters, which is similar to many other non-metric gauging systems such as British Standard Wire Gauge (SWG). However, AWG is dissimilar to IEC 60228, the metric wire-size standard used in most parts of the world, based directly on the wire cross-section area (in square millimetres, mm2)."

Marconi;Technology hardware & equipment;"Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi, 1st Marquess of Marconi (; Italian: […°u éÀà é…õlmo d íoÀàvanni maÀàriÀêa marÀàkoÀêni]; 25 April 1874 ‚Äì 20 July 1937) was an Italian electrical engineer, inventor, and politician known for his creation of a practical radio wave-based wireless telegraph system. This led to Marconi being credited as the inventor of radio  and sharing the 1909 Nobel Prize in Physics with Karl Ferdinand Braun ""in recognition of their contributions to the development of wireless telegraphy"".
His work laid the foundation for the development of radio, television, and all modern wireless communication systems.
Marconi was also an entrepreneur and businessman who founded the Wireless Telegraph & Signal Company (which became the Marconi Company) in the United Kingdom in 1897. In 1929, Marconi was ennobled as a marquess (marchese) by Victor Emmanuel III. In 1931, he set up Vatican Radio for Pope Pius XI.


== Biography ==


=== Early years ===
Guglielmo Giovanni Maria Marconi was born in Palazzo Marescalchi in Bologna on 25 April 1874, the second son of Giuseppe Marconi (an Italian aristocratic landowner from Porretta Terme who lived in the countryside of Pontecchio) and his Irish wife Annie Jameson (daughter of Andrew Jameson of Daphne Castle in County Wexford, a land agent, and wife Margaret, daughter of James Cochrane of Glen Lodge, Sligo, and sister of Scottish naturalist James Sligo Jameson, and granddaughter of John Jameson of Dublin, the Scottish founder of whiskey distillers Jameson & Sons). His father, who was a widower with a son, Luigi, married Jameson on 16 April 1864 in Boulogne-sur-Mer, France. Alfonso, Marconi's older brother, was born in 1865. Between the ages of two and six, Marconi and Alfonso lived with their mother in the English town of Bedford. Having an Irish mother helped explain Marconi's many activities in Great Britain and Ireland. When Guglielmo was three years old, on 4 May 1877, Giuseppe Marconi decided to obtain British citizenship."
Hanshin Construction;Construction;"The Great Hanshin Earthquake occurred on January 17, 1995, at 05:46:53 JST in the southern part of Hy≈çgo Prefecture, Japan, including the region known as Hanshin. It measured 6.9 on the moment magnitude scale and had a maximum intensity of 7 on the JMA Seismic Intensity Scale (XI‚ÄìXII on the Modified Mercalli intensity scale). The tremors lasted for approximately 20 seconds. The focus of the earthquake was located 17 km beneath its epicenter, on the northern end of Awaji Island, 20 km away from the center of the city of Kobe.
At least 5,000 people died as a result of this earthquake; about 4,600 of them were from Kobe. Among major cities, Kobe, with its population of 1.5 million, was the closest to the epicenter and hit by the strongest tremors. This was Japan's second deadliest earthquake in the 20th century after the 1923 Great Kant≈ç earthquake, which claimed more than 105,000 lives.


== Earthquake ==
Most of the largest earthquakes in Japan are caused by subduction of the Philippine Sea plate or Pacific plate, with mechanisms that involve either energy released within the subducting plate or the accumulation and sudden release of stress in the overlying plate. Earthquakes of these types are especially frequent in the coastal regions of northeastern Japan.
The Great Hanshin earthquake belonged to a third type, called an ""inland shallow earthquake""."

It has been the tallest tower in Japan since opening in 2012, and reached its full height of 634 meters (2,080 ft) in early 2011, making it the tallest tower in the world, displacing the Canton Tower, and the third tallest structure in the world behind Merdeka 118 (678.9 m or 2,227 ft) and Burj Khalifa (829.8 m or 2,722 ft).
The tower is the primary television and radio broadcast site for the Kant≈ç region; the older Tokyo Tower no longer gives complete digital terrestrial television broadcasting coverage because it is surrounded by high-rise buildings. Skytree was completed on Leap Day, 29 February 2012, with the tower opening to the public on 22 May 2012. The tower is the centrepiece of a large commercial development funded by Tobu Railway (which owns the complex) and a group of six terrestrial broadcasters headed by NHK. Trains stop at the adjacent Tokyo Skytree Station and nearby Oshiage Station. The complex is seven kilometres (4.3 miles) northeast of Tokyo Station. Sumida Aquarium is in the Tokyo Solamachi complex.


== Design ==
The tower's design was published on 24 November 2006, based on the following three concepts:

Fusion of neofuturistic design and the traditional beauty of Japan
Catalyst for revitalization of the city
Contribution to disaster prevention ‚Äì ""Safety and Security""
The base of the tower has a structure similar to a tripod; from a height of about 350 m (1,150 ft) and above, the tower's structure is cylindrical to offer panoramic views of the river and the city. There are observatories at 350 m (1,150 ft), with a capacity of up to 2,000 people, and 450 m (1,480 ft), with a capacity of 900 people. The upper observatory features a spiral, glass-covered skywalk in which visitors ascend the last 5 metres to the highest point at the upper platform."

Casio Computer;Business services & supplies;"A casino is a facility for gambling. Casinos are often built near or combined with hotels, resorts, restaurants, retail shops, cruise ships, and other tourist attractions. Some casinos also host live entertainment, such as stand-up comedy, concerts, and sports.


== Etymology and usage ==
Casino is of Italian origin; the root casa means a house. The term casino may mean a small country villa, summerhouse, or social club. During the 19th century, casino came to include other public buildings where pleasurable activities took place; such edifices were usually built on the grounds of a larger Italian villa or palazzo, and were used to host civic town functions, including dancing, gambling, music listening, and sports. Examples in Italy include Villa Farnese and Villa Giulia, and in the US the Newport Casino in Newport, Rhode Island. In modern-day Italian, a casino is a brothel (also called casa chiusa, literally ""closed house""), a mess (confusing situation), or a noisy environment; a gaming house is spelt casin√≤, with an accent.
Not all casinos are used for gaming. The Catalina Casino, on Santa Catalina Island, California, has never been used for traditional games of chance, which were already outlawed in California by the time it was built."

As one of the oldest American clothing brands, the company originally marketed high-end outdoor clothing but by the early 1980s it had almost entirely changed its direction. In the 1990s, under the leadership of CEO Mike Jeffries, Abercrombie & Fitch underwent a meteoric rise, focusing on ‚Äúcasual luxury‚Äù fashion and specifically ""the good-looking, cool kids"" ‚Äî using sophisticated sexualized advertising, prominently of fashion models in revealing outfits.  
The company has since refocused itself successfully, targeting a more diverse range of customers in their early 20's to mid 40's.


== History ==

The original Abercrombie & Fitch was founded in 1892 in New York City by David T. Abercrombie as an outfitter for the elite outdoorsman. Ezra Fitch‚Äîa wealthy lawyer, real estate developer, and devoted Abercrombie customer‚Äîbought a significant stake in the business in 1900.  In 1904, it was incorporated and renamed ""Abercrombie & Fitch Co.""  Fitch eventually bought out Abercrombie's share of the business, becoming its sole owner from 1907 to 1928.  The company was an elite outfitter of sporting and excursion goods, particularly noted for its expensive shotguns, fishing rods, fishing boats, and tents."

Commercial Federal;Banking;"The Federal Reserve System (often shortened to the Federal Reserve, or simply the Fed) is the central banking system of the United States. It was created on December 23, 1913, with the enactment of the Federal Reserve Act, after a series of financial panics (particularly the panic of 1907) led to the desire for central control of the monetary system in order to alleviate financial crises. Although an instrument of the U.S. government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself ""an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the president or by anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by Congress, and the terms of the members of the board of governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms."" Over the years, events such as the Great Depression in the 1930s and the Great Recession during the 2000s have led to the expansion of the roles and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve System.
Congress established three key objectives for monetary policy in the Federal Reserve Act: maximizing employment, stabilizing prices, and moderating long-term interest rates. The first two objectives are sometimes referred to as the Federal Reserve's dual mandate. Its duties have expanded over the years, and include supervising and regulating banks, maintaining the stability of the financial system, and providing financial services to depository institutions, the U.S. government, and foreign official institutions. The Fed also conducts research into the economy and provides numerous publications, such as the Beige Book and the FRED database.
The Federal Reserve System is composed of several layers. It is governed by the presidentially-appointed board of governors or Federal Reserve Board (FRB). Twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks, located in cities throughout the nation, regulate and oversee privately owned commercial banks."

Pacific Century Regional;Telecommunications services;"The Pacific Century is a rhetorical term describing a potential 21st-century dominance of Pacific Rim countries.


== History ==


=== Precursors ===

The prediction that the Pacific would transcend the Atlantic as a ""center of gravity of world commerce"" has been credited to Marx and Engels. 
Though the concept of an American Pacific Century came to be discussed more towards the 21st century, Christopher Capozzola has argued that an American Pacific Century already happened in the 20th century, with the 1898 American annexation of the Philippines having led into heavy American involvement in the Pacific region. Mark Borthwick has also argued that the parts of the 19th and 20th centuries were Pacific Centuries of sorts, since the westernization that took place in Pacific Asia at the time paved the way for the region's rise.


=== Modern history ===
The concept of a Pacific Century began to receive greater support in the late 20th century as Pacific Asian economies grew rapidly. By the late 1970s, the concept of a Pacific Century was used in America to describe a potential economic integration of America's West Coast with Japan. The 1989 formation of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum was seen as a significant turning point for the Pacific Rim towards a post‚ÄìCold War era, while by 1991, America's transpacific trade had become 1/3rd greater than its transatlantic trade. A consensus began to emerge that Asia would form a significant part of the future and no longer be economically outpaced by America, especially after the 2007‚Äì2008 financial crisis and Great Recession.
In 2011, United States Secretary of State Hillary Clinton announced the beginning of ""America's Pacific Century"" under the ambit of a broader shift in American foreign policy known as the Pivot to Asia. Over time, the concept of a Pacific Century has become intertwined with various developments in the broader neighborhood of Asia and the Indo-Pacific, such as the desire of some Indo-Pacific countries to contain China; America has a history of working against other powers achieving regional dominance in the Pacific stretching back to the 19th century, and so tensions between America and China for dominance in the region have become increasingly relevant."
Standard Pacific;Construction;"The Pacific Time Zone (PT) is a time zone encompassing parts of western Canada, the western United States, and western Mexico. Places in this zone observe standard time by subtracting eight hours from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC‚àí08:00). During daylight saving time, a time offset of UTC‚àí07:00 is used.
In the United States and Canada, this time zone is generically called the Pacific Time Zone. Specifically, time in this zone is referred to as Pacific Standard Time (PST) when standard time is being observed (early November to mid-March), and Pacific Daylight Time (PDT) when daylight saving time (mid-March to early November) is being observed. In Mexico, the corresponding time zone is known as the Zona Noroeste (Northwest Zone) and observes the same daylight saving schedule as the United States and Canada. The largest city in the Pacific Time Zone is Los Angeles, whose metropolitan area is also the largest in the time zone.
The zone is two hours ahead of the Hawaii‚ÄìAleutian Time Zone, one hour ahead of the Alaska Time Zone, one hour behind the Mountain Time Zone, two hours behind the Central Time Zone, three hours behind the Eastern Time Zone, and four hours behind the Atlantic Time Zone.


== Canada ==

CPP Investments is one of the world's largest investors in private equity, having invested over US$28.1 billion between 2010 and 2014 alone. Despite being a Crown corporation, CPPIB is not considered a sovereign wealth fund because it operates at arm's length from the Government of Canada and solely manages CPP contributions paid by workers and employers, not public funds.
As of December 31, 2024, the CPP Investment Board manages over C$699 billion in assets under management for the Canada Pension Plan on behalf of 22 million Canadians. Canadians contributed $15.9 billion to the fund from individual payroll deductions in fiscal 2024.
CPP Investments is one of Canada's top eight pension funds, nicknamed the ""Maple 8"" or ""Maple Revolutionaries.""


== History ==

The Canada Pension Plan was established in 1966. For much of its history, the plan relied on contributions to pay benefits. By 1996, the federal government had determined that the CPP as then constituted was unsustainable. Changes were made to the plan, gradually increasing the contribution rate to its current 9.9% and creating the CPP Investment Board.
Under the direction of then Minister of Finance Paul Martin, the CPP Investment Board was created by an Act of Parliament in 1997 as an independent, but accountable, body to monitor the funds held by the Canada Pension Plan."

LogicaCMG;Business services & supplies;"Logic is the study of correct reasoning. It includes both formal and informal logic. Formal logic is the study of deductively valid inferences or logical truths. It examines how conclusions follow from premises based on the structure of arguments alone, independent of their topic and content. Informal logic is associated with informal fallacies, critical thinking, and argumentation theory. Informal logic examines arguments expressed in natural language whereas formal logic uses formal language. When used as a countable noun, the term ""a logic"" refers to a specific logical formal system that articulates a proof system. Logic plays a central role in many fields, such as philosophy, mathematics, computer science, and linguistics.
Logic studies arguments, which consist of a set of premises that leads to a conclusion. An example is the argument from the premises ""it's Sunday"" and ""if it's Sunday then I don't have to work"" leading to the conclusion ""I don't have to work."" Premises and conclusions express propositions or claims that can be true or false."

As the largest space station ever constructed, it primarily serves as a platform for conducting scientific experiments in microgravity and studying the space environment.
The station is divided into two main sections: the Russian Orbital Segment (ROS), developed by Roscosmos, and the US Orbital Segment (USOS), built by NASA, ESA, JAXA, and CSA. A striking feature of the ISS is the Integrated Truss Structure, which connect the station‚Äôs vast system of solar panels and radiators to its pressurized modules. These modules support diverse functions, including scientific research, crew habitation, storage, spacecraft control, and airlock operations. The ISS has eight docking and berthing ports for visiting spacecraft. The station orbits the Earth at an average altitude of 400 kilometres (250 miles) and circles the Earth in roughly 93 minutes, completing 15.5 orbits per day.
The ISS programme combines two previously planned crewed Earth-orbiting stations: the United States' Space Station Freedom and the Soviet Union's Mir-2. The first ISS module was launched in 1998, with major components delivered by Proton and Soyuz rockets and the Space Shuttle. Long-term occupancy began on 2 November 2000, with the arrival of the Expedition 1 crew. Since then, the ISS has remained continuously inhabited for 24 years and 189 days, the longest continuous human presence in space."
Career Education;Business services & supplies;"Vocational education is education that prepares people for a skilled craft. Vocational education can also be seen as that type of education given to an individual to prepare that individual to be gainfully employed or self employed with requisite skill. Vocational education is known by a variety of names, depending on the country concerned, including career and technical education, or acronyms such as TVET (technical and vocational education and training; used by UNESCO) and TAFE (technical and further education). TVE refers to all forms and levels of education which provide knowledge and skills related to occupations in various sectors of economic and social life through formal, non-formal and informal learning methods in both school-based and work-based learning contexts. To achieve its aims and purposes, TVE focuses on the learning and mastery of specialized techniques and the scientific principles underlying those techniques, as well as general knowledge, skills and values.
A vocational school is a type of educational institution specifically designed to provide vocational education.
Vocational education can take place at the post-secondary, further education, or higher education level and can interact with the apprenticeship system. At the post-secondary level, vocational education is often provided by highly specialized trade schools, technical schools, community colleges, colleges of further education (UK), vocational universities, and institutes of technology (formerly called polytechnic institutes).


== Overview ==
Historically, almost all vocational education took place in the classroom or on the job site, with students learning trade skills and trade theory from accredited instructors or established professionals. However, in recent years, online vocational education has grown in popularity, making learning various trade skills and soft skills from established professionals easier than ever for students, even those who may live far away from a traditional vocational school."

Sumikin Bussan;Trading companies;"The Sumitomo Group (Japanese: ‰ΩèÂèã„Ç∞„É´„Éº„Éó, Hepburn: Sumitomo Gur≈´pu) is a Japanese corporate group and keiretsu that traces its roots to the zaibatsu groups that were dissolved after World War II. Unlike the zaibatsu of the pre-war period, there is no controlling company with regulatory power. Instead, the companies in the group hold shares in each other, but they are limited to exchanging information and coordinating plans through regular meetings.


== History ==
The Sumitomo Group traces its roots to a bookshop in Kyoto founded circa 1615 by Masatomo Sumitomo, a former Buddhist monk. Even today, management of the group is guided by his ""Founder's Precepts"", written in the 17th century.
Copper refining made the company famous. Riemon Soga, Masatomo Sumitomo's brother-in-law, learned Western methods of copper refining. In 1590, he established a smelting business, Izumiya, literally meaning ""spring shop"". Riemon perfected techniques that allowed the extraction of silver from copper ore, something Japanese technology had not previously accomplished.
The smelting and smithing business was moved from Kyoto to Osaka by the late 17th century. Soga passed control of the company to his son Tomomochi who managed its transformation into a major trading house during the Edo period."

Belo;Media;"A bell is a directly struck idiophone percussion instrument. Most bells have the shape of a hollow cup that when struck vibrates in a single strong strike tone, with its sides forming an efficient resonator. The strike may be made by an internal ""clapper"" or ""uvula"", an external hammer, or‚Äîin small bells‚Äîby a small loose sphere enclosed within the body of the bell (jingle bell).
Bells are usually cast from bell metal (a type of bronze) for its resonant properties, but can also be made from other hard materials. This depends on the function. Some small bells such as ornamental bells or cowbells can be made from cast or pressed metal, glass or ceramic, but large bells such as a church, clock and tower bells are normally cast from bell metal.
Bells intended to be heard over a wide area can range from a single bell hung in a turret or bell-gable, to a musical ensemble such as an English ring of bells, a carillon or a Russian zvon which are tuned to a common scale and installed in a bell tower. Many public or institutional buildings house bells, most commonly as clock bells to sound the hours and quarters.
Historically, bells have been associated with religious rites, and are still used to call communities together for religious services. Later, bells were made to commemorate important events or people and have been associated with the concepts of peace and freedom."

Mercantil Servicios Fin;Diversified financials;"On 29 October 2024, torrential rain caused by an isolated low-pressure area at high levels brought over a year's worth of precipitation to several areas in eastern Spain, including the Valencian Community, Castilla‚ÄìLa Mancha, and Andalusia. The resulting floodwaters caused the deaths of about 232 people, with three more missing and substantial property damage. It is one of the deadliest natural disasters in Spanish history.
Though similar torrential rain events had happened in the past in the region, the flooding was more intense, likely due to the effects of climate change. The poor preparation and disaster response of the regional and national governments also likely aggravated the human cost of the event, notably in Valencia. After the flooding, thousands of volunteers from all around Spain and numerous nonprofit organizations mobilized to help with the cleanup and recovery.


== Background ==
Disastrous floods have been reported throughout the history of Valencia, from the 14th century up to the contemporary period. The 1957 Valencia flood was caused by a three-day cold drop (Spanish: gota fr√≠a) (which usually leads to heavy autumn rains in Spain and France); it overflowed the banks of the T√∫ria river and devastated the city of Valencia.
The 1957 flood resulted in at least 81 fatalities.  In response, the government of Francisco Franco initiated work on a ""Southern Solution"" (Spanish: Soluci√≥n Sur), a giant canal to reroute the T√∫ria River around the south of the city centre, three kilometres from its original course."

SCB was founded as the Book Club on 4 October 1904 by Prince Jayanta Mongkol, a brother of King Chulalongkorn (Rama V), who was convinced that the time was ripe for Siam to have its own banking system to help foster the country's economic development, rather than rely on foreign banks operating branches in the country. The name ""Book Club"" was chosen in an effort to keep the project sub rosa as it was something of an experiment. After the success of the Book Club, King Chulalongkorn granted royal approval for it to officially operate as a commercial bank under the name ""Siam Commercial Bank"" on 30 January 1907.
SCB opened its headquarters in Bangkok's Talat Noi District in 1910. In 1911, it was granted approval to display the royal Garuda symbol as a royal warrant by King Vajiravudh (Rama VI).

The company emerged from what was originally called the Eisenbahn-Actiengesellschaft Schaftlach-Gmund (Schaftlach-Gmund Railway Company Ltd), founded in 1882, which built the 7.6 km long railway line between these villages. It is suspected that Ferdinand von Miller, amongst others, played a decisive role.

Tosoh;Chemicals;"Toso (Â±†Ëòá), or o-toso, is spiced medicinal sake traditionally drunk during Japanese New Year celebrations. Toso is also known historically in China.


== Culture ==

Toso is drunk to flush away the previous year's maladies and to aspire to lead a long life. For generations it has been said that ""if one person drinks this his family will not fall ill; if the whole family does no-one in the village will fall ill"" and has been a staple part of New Year's osechi cuisine in Japan.

Toso is written using two kanji: Ëòá representing evil spirits and Â±† meaning to slaughter.
Toso is made by combining several medicinal herbs to form tososan (Â±†ËòáÊï£), a spicy mixture, which is then soaked in sake or mirin. If made with mirin, essentially a sweet sake, it is suitable for drinking, but using fermented mirin seasoning would not be appropriate as it is too salty.
Three sizes of cup, called sakazuki (ÁõÉ) (see picture), are used starting with the smallest and passed round with each family member or guest taking a sip. Drinking rituals differ by region, but in formal situations would proceed from youngest to eldest. This tradition originated in China in hope for children to grow faster whereas their elders to age slower."

Balfour Beatty;Construction;"Balfour Beatty plc () is an international infrastructure group based in the United Kingdom with capabilities in construction services, support services and infrastructure investments. A constituent of the FTSE 250 Index, the company is active across the UK, US and Hong Kong. In terms of turnover, Balfour Beatty was ranked in 2021 as the biggest construction contractor in the United Kingdom.
It was formed on 12 January 1909 by the engineer George Balfour and the accountant Andrew Beatty. Initially working on tramways, the company soon expanded into power and general contracting; the First World War saw it construct several army bases and various other works to support the British war effort. During the 1920s and 1930s, Balfour Beatty reoriented away from bus and tramway operations towards 
more lucrative heavy civil engineering, particularly the development of Britain's National Grid and various power stations. Early international projects include hydro electric power schemes in the Dolomites, Malaya and India, power stations in Argentina and Uruguay, and the Kut Barrage on the Tigris in Iraq. During the Second World War, the company's construction efforts were dominated by the war effort, including blocking the approaches to Scapa Flow and the building of six Mulberry harbour units.
For a time, Balfour Beatty's activities were dominated by two domestic sectors: power stations and the railways. It also opted to develop its presence as contractor within various power and civil engineering projects."

Before its bus franchise lapsed in 1998, it was the first motor bus operator in Hong Kong, and was responsible for the introduction of the iconic double-decker buses to Hong Kong Island. Currently CMB does not run any transport services and has since shifted into property development as an alternative means of profit.

Ngan Shing-kwan and Wong Yiu Nam formed the China Motor Bus Company, Limited, in 1923 to provide transport services in the Kowloon Peninsula of Hong Kong. Prior to this, Ngan had operated a rickshaw business also within the Kowloon Peninsula. In 1933, the company received an exclusive bus franchise agreement from the Government of Hong Kong to operate routes on Hong Kong Island.
After World War II, the network of CMB's routes expanded alongside exploding population on the island. New buses were purchased to increase ridership. In the mid-1970s, a livery of a buff upper body and a blue lower body was adopted. CMB adopted a policy of improving its service during the 1970s, by introducing a new type of rear-engined bus (Daimler Fleetline) and reforming the route number system."

Antofagasta;Materials;"Antofagasta (Spanish pronunciation: [antofaÀà…£asta] ) is a port city in northern Chile, about 1,100 kilometres (700 mi) north of Santiago.  It is the capital of Antofagasta Province and Antofagasta Region.  According to the 2015 census, the city has a population of 402,669.
Once claimed by Bolivia following the Spanish American wars of independence, Antofagasta was captured by Chile on 14 February 1879, triggering the War of the Pacific (1879‚Äì83). Chilean sovereignty was officially recognised by Bolivia under the terms of the 1904 Treaty of Peace and Friendship.
The city of Antofagasta is closely linked to mining activity, being a port and the chief service hub for one of Chile's major mining areas. While silver and saltpeter mining have been historically important for Antofagasta, since the mid-19th century copper mining is by far the most important mining activity for Antofagasta, fueling a steady growth in the areas of construction, retail, hotel accommodations, population growth and skyline development until the end of the 2000s commodities boom in 2013. 
Since the 2010s Antofagasta is also a service hub for lithium mining.
In 2012, Antofagasta has the highest GDP per capita of Chile, US$37,000 and the 3rd place for Human Development Index just after Metropolitana de Santiago Region and Magallanes and Ant√°rtica Chilena Region.

WMC Resources;Materials;"WMC Resources Limited was an Australian diversified mining company.


== History ==
Western Mining Corporation (WMC) was formed in 1933, when William Robinson, the Australian-born London-based managing director of Broken Hill Associated Smelters, was able to interest several large London-based mining companies into forming syndicates to develop gold mines in Australia. WMC's strategy was to use the newly emerging sciences of mining geology and related geochemistry and geophysics to find new gold deposits. It was a company based on the idea that if they applied good science to exploration, they would be successful.
WMC began operations in Western Australia in December 1933 when it commenced an extensive aerial survey of the Eastern Goldfields. It acquired its first profitable mining operation in June 1935 when it took an option over a new gold discovery at Cox's Find, 43 miles northwest of Laverton.
WMC pioneered district-scale aerial photography in the 1930s, flying many areas in West Australia's gold-mining districts. The hope was to identify new prospective areas near known mines. Unfortunately, the surveys failed due to poor exposures of the rocks in the nearly flat, deeply-weathered areas they flew.
In 1961, WMC acquired a 20% shareholding in Alcoa World Alumina & Chemicals that later increased to 40%."

The company's activities cover transport, haulage and terminal operations, ship's agency, dredging and marine consultancy.

Ports formerly owned by rail and canal companies were nationalised in 1947 by Clement Attlee's post Second World War Attlee government, forming part of the operations of the British Transport Commission. The commission was split in 1962 by the Transport Act 1962; the British Transport Docks Board (BTDB) was formed in 1962 as a government-owned body to manage various ports throughout Great Britain.
In 1981 the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher implemented the Transport Act 1981, which provided for the BTDB's privatisation. Because of BTDB's statutory powers as a harbour operator, a straightforward conversion to limited company status was impractical. Instead, BTDB was renamed as Associated British Ports (ABP) and a limited company, Associated British Ports Holdings Ltd. (ABPH), was created, with the same powers in law over ABP as a holding company has over a subsidiary.
In 1983 the British Government allowed the company to become a public limited company quoted on the London Stock Exchange. The company was taken over by a consortium of companies in 2006 and, in August of that year, the company was delisted from the London Stock Exchange."

== History ==
The horses of South America descend from Andalusian and other Iberian stock brought to the western hemisphere by the Spanish. In the southern part of the continent, significant numbers of these horses developed within geographically isolated conditions and by the mid-nineteenth century there were some small, inbred animals in the herds of Mapuche of southern Buenos Aires province in Olavarr√≠a, Argentina. The Falabella was originally developed in Argentina from local horses of Criollo stock, beginning in 1868 with the breeding program of Patrick Newtall. When Newtall died, the herd and breeding methods were passed to his son-in-law, Juan Falabella. He added additional bloodlines, including the Welsh Pony, Shetland pony, and small Thoroughbreds. With considerable inbreeding, he was able to gain consistently small size within the herd.
Beginning in the 1940s, a descendant, Julio C. Falabella, created a formal breed registry, the Establecimientos Falabella,  now the Asociaci√≥n de Criadores de Caballos Falabella (Falabella Horse Breeders Association), and worked to standardize the breed to reach a consistent height, first achieving an average size of under 100 cm (40 in)  Later breeders developed the modern standard, a horse breed that averaged approximately 76 cm (30 in) in height.

== History ==


=== Foundation and early years ===

BayWa's history goes back to the Bayerische Zentral-Darlehenskasse (BZDK), which was founded in 1893, and was active in both the banking and commodities business. One of its central tasks was to enable farmers to purchase means of production at low cost and to market their products profitably. In 1920, the BZDK had hundreds of warehouses for grain, artificial fertilizers, feedstuffs, and machinery, mainly in southern Germany. As a result of the First World War, economic conditions steadily deteriorated. The devaluation of cash and bank deposits led to hyperinflation, which prompted the BZDK to separate its banking and merchandise business. The general meeting on January 17, 1923, thus marked the founding of the Bayerische Warenvermittlung landwirtschaftlicher Genossenschaften in the legal form of a stock corporation."

SEB;Consumer durables;"Sex is the biological trait that determines whether a sexually reproducing organism produces male or female gametes. During sexual reproduction, a male and a female gamete fuse to form a zygote, which develops into an offspring that inherits traits from each parent.  By convention, organisms that produce smaller, more mobile gametes (spermatozoa, sperm) are called male, while organisms that produce larger, non-mobile gametes (ova, often called egg cells) are called female. An organism that produces both types of gamete is hermaphrodite.  
In non-hermaphroditic species, the sex of an individual is determined through one of several biological sex-determination systems.  Most mammalian species have the XY sex-determination system, where the male usually carries an X and a Y chromosome (XY), and the female usually carries two X chromosomes (XX). Other chromosomal sex-determination systems in animals include the ZW system in birds, and the XO system in some insects. Various environmental systems include temperature-dependent sex determination in reptiles and crustaceans.
The male and female of a species may be physically alike (sexual monomorphism) or have physical differences (sexual dimorphism).  In sexually dimorphic species, including most birds and mammals, the sex of an individual is usually identified through observation of that individual's sexual characteristics."

Daewoo Intl;Trading companies;"The GM Small Gasoline Engine (SGE) is a family of small-displacement, inline three- and four-cylinder gasoline engines ranging from 1.0 L to 1.5 L, developed by Adam Opel AG, Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation (SAIC), MG Motor (MG), Shanghai GM (SGM), and the Pan-Asia Technical Automotive Center (PATAC).
The new global family is designed to improve fuel economy, performance, and emissions, while reducing noise and vibrations. To achieve this, it features a lightweight design and advanced technologies like gasoline direct injection, turbocharging, variable-length intake manifolds, and alternative fuel compatibility. It uses a modular approach with interchangeable components that can be suited to specific applications.
The SGE has been available in the following displacements: 

999 cc (1.0 L; 61.0 cu in) I3 DI DCVCP turbo 77.4 mm (3.05 in) stroke,
1,118 cc (1.1 L; 68.2 cu in) I3 PFI 86.6 mm (3.41 in) stroke,
1,399 cc (1.4 L; 85.4 cu in) I4 DI DCVCP turbo 81.3 mm (3.20 in) stroke, and
1,490 cc (1.5 L; 90.9 cu in) I4 PFI 86.6 mm (3.41 in) stroke
All engines share a common block design (depending on the number of cylinders) and a 74 mm (2.91 in) bore with 81 mm (3.19 in) bore spacing. The one-stage single-scroll turbocharger in turbocharged variants is supplied by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
To reduce noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) levels, the direct injection fuel rail mounts to the cylinder head and valve cover via bushings that isolate the loud ticking noise that injector pintles make. GM claims that the 1.0-liter turbo is 25 percent (3 dBA) quieter than the Ford Fiesta's 1.0-liter turbo, and the 1.4-liter is up to 50 percent (6 dBA) quieter than the VW/Audi 1.4-liter turbo. Other silencing measures include a bed-plate cylinder block that increases stiffness and a stiffened aluminum front cam cover. Three-cylinder variants get a balance shaft that is integrated with the oil pump and located inside the two-piece aluminum oil pan to prevent radiated noise."
